# The Complete Poems of Emily Dickinson

This repo contains the complete poems of Emily Dickinson in the [poems](./poems/) folder. The poems have been OCR'd and only 344 of them have been manually corrected, so there are likely still many errors. Also, as part of the OCR process I ran them through GPT4 and told it to fix any spelling mistakes, and it seems it has randomly replaced some of the words as well (I noticed around 1 word substitution per 100 poems or so).

So, *Caveat Lector*.

# Selected Poems

In the process of reading them, I put some of them into categories. I developed the categories as I was reading. If I categorized them, this is an endorsement, but some categories are bigger endorsements than others. So, I have collected some of the categories into pdfs:
- [Nature and the Natural World](./selected_poems/emily_on_nature.pdf) (87 poems)
- [Time, Scale and Eternity](./selected_poems/emily_on_time.pdf) (47 poems)
- [Emily](./selected_poems/emily_on_emily.pdf) (55 poems)
- [Day, Night and Insomnia](./selected_poems/emily_on_day_and_night.pdf) (34 poems)

The raw lists are in [lists](./lists/) as lists of poem numbers and as rendered pdfs of those poems. A total of 344 poems were selected out of 1775.

Of the raw lists, I think the following are best:
- [Images](./lists/Images.pdf) (25 poems)
- [Madness](./lists/Madness.pdf) (13 poems)
- [Autobiography](./lists/Autobiography.pdf) (34 poems)
- [Love](./lists/Love.pdf) (31 poems)
- [Misc](./lists/Misc.pdf) (39 poems)
- [Fun](./lists/Fun.pdf) (29 poems)
