<p>178</p>
<p>I cautious, scanned my little life–<br>
I winnowed what would fade<br>
From what would last till Heads like mine<br>
Should be a-dreaming laid.</p>
<p>I put the latter in a Barn–<br>
The former, blew away.<br>
I went one winter morning<br>
And lo– my priceless Hay</p>
<p>Was not upon the “Scaffold”–<br>
Was not upon the “Beam”–<br>
And from a thriving Farmer–<br>
A Cynic, I became.</p>
<p>Whether a Thief did it–<br>
Whether It was the wind–<br>
Whether Deity’s guiltless–<br>
My business is, to find!</p>
<p>So I begin to ransack!<br>
How is it Hearts, with Thee?<br>
Art thou within the little Barn<br>
Love provided Thee?</p>
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
<p>279</p>
<p>Tie the Strings to my Life, My Lord,<br>
Then, I am ready to go!<br>
Just a look at the Horses–<br>
Rapid! That will do!</p>
<p>Put me in on the firmest side–<br>
So I shall never fall–<br>
For we must ride to the Judgment–<br>
And it’s partly, down Hill–</p>
<p>But never I mind the steepest–<br>
And never I mind the Sea–<br>
Held fast in Everlasting Race–<br>
By my own Choice, and Thee–</p>
<p>Goodbye to the Life I used to live–<br>
And the World I used to know–<br>
And kiss the Hills, for me, just once–<br>
Then– I am ready to go!</p>
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
<p>285</p>
<p>The Robin’s my Criterion for Tune–<br>
Because I grow– where Robins do–<br>
But, were I Cuckoo born,<br>
I’d swear by him–<br>
The ode familiar– rules the Noon–<br>
The Buttercup’s, my Whim for Bloom–<br>
Because, we’re Orchard sprung–<br>
But, were I Britain born,<br>
I’d Daisies spurn–<br>
None but the Nut– October fit–<br>
Because, through dropping it,<br>
The Seasons flit– I’m taught–<br>
Without the Snow’s Tableau–<br>
Winter, were he– to me<br>
Because I see– New Englandly–<br>
The Queen, discerns like me–<br>
Provincially– </p><div style="page-break-after: always;"></div> 298<p></p>
<p>Alone, I cannot be–<br>
For Hosts– do visit me–<br>
Recordless Company–<br>
Who baffle Key–</p>
<p>They have no Robes, nor Names–<br>
No Almanacs– nor Climes–<br>
But general Homes<br>
Like Gnomes–</p>
<p>Their Coming, may be known–<br>
By Couriers within–<br>
Their going– is not–<br>
For they’re never gone–</p>
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
<p>303</p>
<p>The Soul selects her own Society–<br>
Then– shuts the Door–<br>
To her divine Majority–<br>
Present no more–</p>
<p>Unmoved– she notes the Chariots– pausing–<br>
At her low Gate–<br>
Unmoved– an Emperor be kneeling–<br>
Upon her Mat–</p>
<p>I’ve known her– from an ample nation–<br>
Choose One–<br>
Then– close the Valves of her attention–<br>
Like Stone–</p>
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
<p>323</p>
<p>As if I asked a Common Alms,<br>
And in my wondering hand<br>
A Stranger pressed a Kingdom,<br>
And I, bewildered, stand–</p>
<p>As if I asked the Orient<br>
Had it for me a Morn–<br>
And it should lift its purple Dikes,<br>
And shatter me with Dawn!</p>
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
<p>326</p>
<p>I cannot dance upon my Toes–<br>
No Man instructed me–<br>
But oftentimes, among my mind,<br>
A Glee possesseth me,</p>
<p>That had I Ballet knowledge–<br>
Would put itself abroad<br>
In Pirouette to blanch a Troupe–<br>
Or lay a Prima, mad,</p>
<p>And though I had no Gown of Gauze–<br>
No Ringlet, to my Hair,<br>
Nor hopped to Audiences– like Birds,<br>
One Claw upon the Air,</p>
<p>Nor tossed my shape in Eider Balls,<br>
Nor rolled on wheels of snow<br>
Till I was out of sight, in sound,<br>
The House encore me so–</p>
<p>Nor any know I know the Art<br>
I mention– easy– Here–<br>
Nor any Placard boast me–<br>
It’s full as Opera– </p><div style="page-break-after: always;"></div> 327<p></p>
<p>Before I got my eye put out<br>
I liked as well to see–<br>
As other Creatures, that have Eyes<br>
And know no other way–</p>
<p>But were it told to me– Today–<br>
That I might have the sky<br>
For mine– I tell you that my Heart<br>
Would split, for size of me–</p>
<p>The Meadows– mine–<br>
The Mountains– mine–<br>
All Forests– Stintless Stars–<br>
As much of Noon as I could take<br>
Between my finite eyes–</p>
<p>The Motions of the Dipping Birds–<br>
The Morning’s Amber Road–<br>
For mine– to look at when I liked–<br>
The News would strike me dead–</p>
<p>So safer– guess– with just my soul<br>
Upon the Window pane–<br>
Where other Creatures put their eyes–<br>
Incautious– of the Sun– </p><div style="page-break-after: always;"></div> 348<p></p>
<p>I dreaded that first Robin, so,<br>
But He is mastered, now,<br>
I’m someway accustomed to Him grown,<br>
He hurts a little, though–</p>
<p>I thought if I could only live<br>
Till that first Shout got by–<br>
Not all Pianos in the Woods<br>
Had power to mangle me–</p>
<p>I dared not meet the Daffodils<br>
For fear their Yellow Gown<br>
Would pierce me with a fashion<br>
So foreign to my own–</p>
<p>I wished the Grass would hurry–<br>
So– when ’twas time to see–<br>
He’d be too tall, the tallest one<br>
Could stretch– to look at me–</p>
<p>I could not bear the Bees should come,<br>
I wished they’d stay away<br>
In those dim countries where they go,<br>
What word had they, for me?</p>
<p>They’re here, though; not a creature failed–<br>
No Blossom stayed away<br>
In gentle deference to me–<br>
The Queen of Calvary–</p>
<p>Each one salutes me, as he goes,<br>
And I, my childish Plumes,<br>
Lift, in bereaved acknowledgment<br>
Of their unmindful Drums–</p>
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
<p>376</p>
<p>Of Course– I prayed–<br>
And did God Care?<br>
He cared as much as on the Air<br>
A Bird– had stamped her foot–<br>
And cried “Give Me”–<br>
My Reason– Life–<br>
I had not had– but for Yourself–<br>
’Twere better Charity<br>
To leave me in the Atom’s Tomb–<br>
Merry, and Nought, and gay, and numb–<br>
Than this smart Misery. </p><div style="page-break-after: always;"></div> 405<p></p>
<p>It might be lonelier<br>
Without the Loneliness–<br>
I’m so accustomed to my Fate–<br>
Perhaps the Other Peace–</p>
<p>Would interrupt the Dark–<br>
And crowd the little Room–<br>
Too scant– by Cubits– to contain<br>
The Sacrament– of Him–</p>
<p>I am not used to Hope–<br>
It might intrude upon–<br>
Its sweet parade– blaspheme the place<br>
Ordained to Suffering–</p>
<p>It might be easier<br>
To fail– with Land in Sight–<br>
Than gain– My Blue Peninsula–<br>
To perish– of Delight–</p>
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
<p>441</p>
<p>This is my letter to the World<br>
That never wrote to Me–<br>
The Simple News that Nature told–<br>
With tender Majesty–</p>
<p>Her Message is committed<br>
To Hands I cannot see–<br>
For love of Her– Sweet countrymen–<br>
Judge tenderly– of Me–</p>
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
<p>466</p>
<p>’Tis little I– could care for Pearls–<br>
Who own the ample sea–<br>
Or Brooches– when the Emperor–<br>
With Rubles– pelteth me–</p>
<p>Or Gold– who am the Prince of Mines–<br>
Or Diamonds– when have I<br>
A Diadem to fit a Dome–<br>
Continual upon me– </p><div style="page-break-after: always;"></div> 486<p></p>
<p>I was the slightest in the House–<br>
I took the smallest Room–<br>
At night, my little Lamp, and Book–<br>
And one Geranium–</p>
<p>So stationed I could catch the Mint<br>
That never ceased to fall–<br>
And just my Basket–<br>
Let me think– I’m sure–</p>
<p>That this was all–<br>
I never spoke– unless addressed–<br>
And then, ’twas brief and low–<br>
I could not bear to live– aloud–<br>
The Racket shamed me so–</p>
<p>And if it had not been so far–<br>
And anyone I knew<br>
Were going– I had often thought<br>
How noteless– I could die–</p>
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
<p>508</p>
<p>I’m ceded– I’ve stopped being Theirs–<br>
The name They dropped upon my face<br>
With water, in the country church<br>
Is finished using, now,<br>
And They can put it with my Dolls,<br>
My childhood, and the string of spools,<br>
I’ve finished threading– too–</p>
<p>Baptized, before, without the Choice,<br>
But this time, consciously, of Grace–<br>
Unto supremest name–<br>
Called to my Full– The Crescent dropped–<br>
Existence’s whole Arc, filled up,<br>
With one small Diadem.</p>
<p>My second Rank– too small the first–<br>
Crowned– Crowing– on my Father’s breast–<br>
A half unconscious Queen–<br>
But this time– Adequate– Erect,<br>
With Will to choose, or to reject,<br>
And I choose, just a Crown–</p>
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
<p>561</p>
<p>I measure every Grief I meet<br>
With narrow, probing, Eyes–<br>
I wonder if It weighs like Mine–<br>
Or has an Easier size.</p>
<p>I wonder if They bore it long–<br>
Or did it just begin–<br>
I could not tell the Date of Mine–<br>
It feels so old a pain–</p>
<p>I wonder if it hurts to live–<br>
And if They have to try–<br>
And whether– could They choose between–<br>
It would not be– to die–</p>
<p>I note that Some– gone patient long–<br>
At length, renew their smile–<br>
An Imitation of a Light<br>
That has so little Oil–</p>
<p>I wonder if when Years have piled–<br>
Some Thousands– on the Harm<br>
That hurt them early– such a lapse<br>
Could give them any Balm–</p>
<p>Or would they go on aching still–<br>
Through Centuries of Nerve–<br>
Enlightened to a larger Pain–<br>
In Contrast with the Love–</p>
<p>The Grieved– are many– I am told–<br>
There is the various Cause–<br>
Death– is but one– and comes but once–<br>
And only nails the eyes–</p>
<p>There’s Grief of Want– and Grief of Cold–<br>
A sort they call “Despair”–<br>
There’s Banishment from native Eyes–<br>
In sight of Native Air–</p>
<p>And though I may not guess the kind–<br>
Correctly– yet to me<br>
A piercing Comfort it affords<br>
In passing Calvary–</p>
<p>To note the fashions– of the Cross–<br>
And how they’re mostly worn–<br>
Still fascinated to presume<br>
That Some– are like My Own–</p>
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
<p>563</p>
<p>I could not prove the Years had feet–<br>
Yet confident they run<br>
Am I, from symptoms that are past<br>
And Series that are done–</p>
<p>I find my feet have further Goals–<br>
I smile upon the Aims<br>
That felt so ample– Yesterday–<br>
Today’s– have vaster claims–</p>
<p>I do not doubt the self I was<br>
Was competent to me–<br>
But something awkward in the fit–<br>
Proves that– outgrown– I see–</p>
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
<p>576</p>
<p>I prayed, at first, a little Girl,<br>
Because they told me to–<br>
But stopped, when qualified to guess<br>
How prayer would feel– to me–</p>
<p>If I believed God looked around,<br>
Each time my Childish eye<br>
Fixed full, and steady, on his own<br>
In Childish honesty–</p>
<p>And told him what I’d like, today,<br>
And parts of his far plan<br>
That baffled me– The mingled side<br>
Of his Divinity–</p>
<p>And often since, in Danger,<br>
I count the force ’twould be<br>
To have a God so strong as that<br>
To hold my life for me–</p>
<p>Till I could take the Balance<br>
That tips so frequent, now,<br>
It takes me all the while to poise–<br>
And then– it doesn’t stay–</p>
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
<p>613</p>
<p>They shut me up in Prose–<br>
As when a little Girl<br>
They put me in the Closet–<br>
Because they liked me “still”–</p>
<p>Still! Could themself have peeped–<br>
And seen my Brain– go round–<br>
They might as wise have lodged a Bird<br>
For Treason– in the Pound–</p>
<p>Himself has but to will<br>
And easy as a Star<br>
Abolish his Captivity–<br>
And laugh– No more have I–</p>
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
<p>644</p>
<p>You left me– Sire– two Legacies–<br>
A Legacy of Love<br>
A Heavenly Father would suffice<br>
Had He the offer of–</p>
<p>You left me Boundaries of Pain–<br>
Capacious as the Sea–<br>
Between Eternity and Time–<br>
Your Consciousness– and Me–</p>
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
<p>663</p>
<p>Again– his voice is at the door–<br>
I feel the old Degree–<br>
I hear him ask the servant<br>
For such an one– as me–</p>
<p>I take a flower– as I go–<br>
My face to justify–<br>
He never saw me– in this life–<br>
I might surprise his eye!</p>
<p>I cross the Hall with mingled steps–<br>
I– silent– pass the door–<br>
I look on all this world contains–<br>
Just his face– nothing more!</p>
<p>We talk in careless– and in toss–<br>
A kind of plummet strain–<br>
Each– sounding– shyly–<br>
Just– how– deep–<br>
The other’s one– had been–</p>
<p>We walk– I leave my Dog– at home–<br>
A tender– thoughtful Moon–<br>
Goes with us– just a little way–<br>
And– then– we are alone–</p>
<p>Alone– If Angels are “alone”–<br>
First time they try the sky!<br>
Alone– if those “veiled faces” be–<br>
We cannot count– on High!</p>
<p>I’d give– to live that hour– again–<br>
The purple– in my Vein–<br>
But He must count the drops– himself–<br>
My price for every stain!</p>
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
<p>664</p>
<p>Of all the Souls that stand create–<br>
I have elected– One–<br>
When Sense from Spirit– files away–<br>
And Subterfuge– is done–</p>
<p>When that which is– and that which was–<br>
Apart– intrinsic– stand–<br>
And this brief Drama in the flesh–<br>
Is shifted– like a Sand–</p>
<p>When Figures show their royal Front–<br>
And Mists– are carved away,<br>
Behold the Atom– I preferred–<br>
To all the lists of Clay!</p>
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
<p>677</p>
<p>To be alive– is Power–<br>
Existence– in itself–<br>
Without a further function–<br>
Omnipotence– Enough–</p>
<p>To be alone– and Will!<br>
’Tis able as a God–<br>
The Maker– of Ourselves– be what–<br>
Such being– Finitude! </p><div style="page-break-after: always;"></div> 709<p></p>
<p>Publication– is the Auction<br>
Of the Mind of Man–<br>
Poverty– be justifying<br>
For so foul a thing</p>
<p>Possibly– but We– would rather<br>
From Our Garret go<br>
White– Unto the White Creator–<br>
Than invest– Our Snow–</p>
<p>Thought– belong to Him who gave it–<br>
Then– to Him Who bear<br>
Its Corporeal illustration– sell<br>
The Royal Air–</p>
<p>In the Parcel– Be the Merchant<br>
Of the Heavenly Grace–<br>
But reduce no Human Spirit<br>
To Disgrace of Price–</p>
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
<p>711</p>
<p>Strong Draughts of Their Refreshing Minds<br>
To drink– enables Mine<br>
Through Desert or the Wilderness<br>
As bore it Sealed Wine–</p>
<p>To go elastic– Or as One<br>
The Camel’s trait– attained–<br>
How powerful the Stimulus<br>
Of an Hermetic Mind– </p><div style="page-break-after: always;"></div> 754<p></p>
<p>My Life had stood– a Loaded Gun–<br>
In Corners– till a Day<br>
The Owner passed– identified–<br>
And carried Me away–</p>
<p>And now We roam in Sovereign Woods–<br>
And now We hunt the Doe–<br>
And every time I speak for Him–<br>
The Mountains straight reply–</p>
<p>And do I smile, such cordial light<br>
Upon the Valley glow–<br>
It is as a Vesuvian face<br>
Had let its pleasure through–</p>
<p>And when at Night– Our good Day done–<br>
I guard My Master’s Head–<br>
’Tis better than the Eider-Duck’s<br>
Deep Pillow– to have shared–</p>
<p>To foe of His– I’m deadly foe–<br>
None stir the second time–<br>
On whom I lay a Yellow Eye–<br>
Or an emphatic Thumb–</p>
<p>Though I than He– may longer live<br>
He longer must– than I–<br>
For I have but the power to kill,<br>
Without– the power to die–</p>
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
<p>773</p>
<p>Deprived of other Banquet,<br>
I entertained Myself–<br>
At first– a scant Nutrition–<br>
An insufficient Loaf–</p>
<p>But grown by slender addings<br>
To so esteemed a Size–<br>
’Tis sumptuous enough for me–<br>
And almost to suffice–</p>
<p>A Robin’s famine able–<br>
Red Pilgrim, He and I–<br>
A Berry from our table–<br>
Reserve– for Charity–</p>
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
<p>804</p>
<p>No Notice gave She, but a Change–<br>
No Message, but a Sigh–<br>
For Whom, the Time did not suffice<br>
That She should specify.</p>
<p>She was not warm, though Summer shone<br>
Nor scrupulous of cold,<br>
Though Rime by Rime, the steady Frost<br>
Upon Her Bosom piled–</p>
<p>Of shrinking ways– she did not fright<br>
Though all the Village looked–<br>
But held Her gravity aloft–<br>
And met the gaze– direct–</p>
<p>And when adjusted like a Seed<br>
In careful fitted Ground,<br>
Unto the Everlasting Spring–<br>
And hindered but a Mound–</p>
<p>Her Warm return, if so she chose–<br>
And We– imploring drew–<br>
Removed our Invitation by<br>
As Some She never knew–</p>
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
<p>864</p>
<p>The Robin for the Crumb<br>
Returns no syllable<br>
But long records the Lady’s name<br>
In Silver Chronicle.</p>
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
<p>967</p>
<p>Pain– expands the Time–<br>
Ages coil within<br>
The minute Circumference<br>
Of a single Brain–</p>
<p>Pain contracts– the Time–<br>
Occupied with Shot–<br>
Gamuts of Eternities<br>
Are as they were not–</p>
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
<p>968</p>
<p>Fitter to see Him, I may be<br>
For the long Hindrance– Grace– to Me–<br>
With Summers, and with Winters, grow,<br>
Some passing Year– A trait bestow</p>
<p>To make Me fairest of the Earth–<br>
The Waiting– then– will seem so worth–<br>
I shall impute with half a pain–<br>
The blame that I was chosen– then–</p>
<p>Time to anticipate His Gaze–<br>
It’s first– Delight– and then– Surprise–<br>
The turning o’er and o’er my face–<br>
For Evidence it be the Grace–</p>
<p>He left behind One Day– So less–<br>
He seek Conviction, That– be This–<br>
I only must not grow so new<br>
That He’ll mistake– and ask for me–</p>
<p>Of me– when first unto the Door–<br>
I go– to Elsewhere go no more–<br>
I only must not change so fair–<br>
He’ll sigh– “The Other– She– is Where?”</p>
<p>The Love, tho’, will array me right–<br>
I shall be perfect– in His Sight–<br>
If He perceive the other Truth–<br>
Upon an Excellenter Youth–</p>
<p>How sweet I shall not lack in Vain–<br>
But gain– thro’ loss– Through Grief– obtain–<br>
The Beauty that reward Him best–<br>
The Beauty of Demand– at Rest–</p>
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
<p>1581</p>
<p>The farthest Thunder that I heard<br>
Was nearer than the Sky<br>
And rumbles still, though torrid Noons<br>
Have lain their missiles by–</p>
<p>The Lightning that preceded it<br>
Struck no one but myself–<br>
But I would not exchange the Bolt<br>
For all the rest of Life–</p>
<p>Indebtedness to Oxygen<br>
The Happy may repay,<br>
But not the obligation<br>
To Electricity–</p>
<p>It founds the Homes and decks the Days<br>
And every clamor bright<br>
Is but the gleam concomitant<br>
Of that waylaying Light–</p>
<p>The Thought is quiet as a Flake–<br>
A Crash without a Sound,<br>
How Life’s reverberation<br>
Its Explanation found–</p>
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
<p>1732</p>
<p>My life closed twice before its close–<br>
It yet remains to see<br>
If Immortality unveil<br>
A third event to me–</p>
<p>So huge, so hopeless to conceive<br>
As these that twice befell.<br>
Parting is all we know of heaven,<br>
And all we need of hell. </p><div style="page-break-after: always;"></div> 1750<p></p>
<p>The words the happy say<br>
Are paltry melody–<br>
