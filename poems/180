As if some little Arctic flower
Upon the polar hem–
Went wandering down the Latitudes
Until It puzzled came–

To continents of summer–
To firmaments of sun–
To strange, bright crowds of Flowers–
And birds, of foreign tongue!

I say, As if this little Flower
To Eden, wandered in–
What then? Why nothing,
Only, your inference therefrom!
