Here, where the Daisies fit my Head
'Tis easiest to lie–
And every Grass that plays outside
Is sorry, Some, for me–

Where I am not afraid to go
I may confide my Flower–
Who was not Enemy of Me
Will gentle be, to Her–

Nor separate, Herself and Me
By Distances become–
A Single Bloom we constitute
Departed, or at Home–
