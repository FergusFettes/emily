Through lane it lay—through bramble—
Through clearing and through wood—
Banditti often passed us
Upon the lonely road.

The wolf came peering—curious—
The owl looked puzzled down—
The serpent's satin figure
Glide stealthily along—

The tempests touched our garments—
The lightning's poniards gleamed—
Fierce from the Crag above us
The hungry Vulture screamed—

The satyr's fingers beckoned—
The valley murmured "Come"—
These were the mates—This was the road
These children fluttered home.
