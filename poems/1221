Some we see no more,
Tenements of Wonder–
Occupy to us though perhaps to them
Simpler are the Days than the Supposition–

Their removing Manners
Leave us to presume–
That oblique Belief which we call Conjecture
Grapples with a Theme stubborn as Sublime–

Able as the Dust
To equip its feature–
Adequate as Drums–
To enlist the Tomb–
