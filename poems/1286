I thought that Nature was enough
Till Human nature came
But that the other did absorb
As Parallax a Flame—

Of Human nature just aware
There added the Domain—
Brief struggle for capacity
The power to contain—

Is always as the contents
But give a Giant room
And you will lodge a Giant
And not a smaller man—
