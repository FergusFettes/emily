While we were fearing it, it came—
But came with less of fear
Because that fearing it so long
Had almost made it fair—

There is a Fitting—a Dismay—
A Fitting—a Despair—
'Tis harder knowing It is Due
Than knowing it is Here—

The Trying on the Utmost
The Morning it is new
Is Terribler than wearing it
A whole existence through—
