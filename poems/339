I tend my flowers for thee— Bright Absentee!
My Fuchsia's Coral Seams
Rip— while the Sower— dreams—
Geraniums— tint— and spot—

Low Daisies— dot—
My Cactus— splits her Beard
To show her throat—
Carnations— tip their spice—

And Bees— pick up—
A Hyacinth— I hid—
Puts out a Ruffled Head—
And odors fall—

From Vases— so small—
You marvel how they held—
Globe Roses— break their satin Flake—
Upon my Garden Floor—

Yet— thou— not there—
I had as lief they bore
No Crimson— more—
Thy Bower— be gay—

Her Lord— away!
It ill becomes me—
I'll dwell in Calyx— Gray—
How modestly— alway—

Thy Daisy—
Draped for thee!
