Going to Him! Happy letter!
Tell Him—Tell Him the page I didn't write!
Tell Him—I only said the Syntax
And left the Verb and the pronoun out—

Tell Him just how the fingers hurried
Then—how they waded—slow—slow—
And then you wished you had eyes in your pages
So you could see what moved them so

Tell Him—it wasn't a Practised Writer—
You guessed—from the way the sentence toiled—
You could hear the Bodice tug, behind you—
As if it held but the might of a child—

You almost pitied it—you—it worked so—
Tell Him—no—you may quibble there—
For it would split His Heart, to know it—
And then you and I, were silenter.

Tell Him—Night finished—before we finished—
And the Old Clock kept neighing "Day"!
And you—got sleepy—and begged to be ended—
What could It hinder so—to say?

Tell Him—just how she sealed you—Cautious!
But—if He ask where you are hid
Until tomorrow—Happy letter!
Gesture Coquette—and shake your Head!

Version I

Going—to—Her!
Happy—Letter! Tell Her—
Tell Her—the page I never wrote!
Tell Her, I only said—the Syntax—
And left the Verb and the Pronoun—out—

Tell Her just how the fingers—hurried—
Then—how they—stammered—slow—slow—
And then—you wished you had eyes—in your pages—
So you could see—what moved—them—so—

Tell Her—it wasn't a practised writer—
You guessed—From the way the sentence—toiled—
You could hear the Bodice—tug—behind you—
As if it held but the might of a child!

You almost pitied—it—you—it worked so—
Tell Her—No—you may quibble—there—
For it would split Her Heart—to know It—
And then—you and I—were silenter!

Tell Her—Day—finished—before we—finished—
And the old Clock kept neighing—"Day"!
And you—got sleepy—and begged to be ended—
What could—it hinder so—to say?

Tell Her—just how she sealed—you—Cautious!
But—if she ask "where you are hid"—
Until the evening—Ah! Be bashful!
Gesture Coquette—
And shake your Head!
