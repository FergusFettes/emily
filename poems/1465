Before you thought of Spring 
Except as a Surmise 
You see – God bless his suddenness – 
A Fellow In the Skies 

Of independent Hues 
A little weather worn 
Inspiriting habiliments 
Of Indigo and Brown – 

With specimens of Song 
As if for you to choose – 
Discretion in the interval 
With gay delays he goes 

To some Superior Tree 
Without a single Leaf 
And shouts for joy to Nobody 
But his seraphic self –
