How sick - to wait - in any place - but thine -
I knew last night - when Someone tried to twine -
Thinking - perhaps - that I looked tired - or lone
Or breaking - almost - with unspoken pain -

And I turned - ducal -
That right - was thine -
One port - suffices - for a Brig - like mine -

Ours be the tossing - wild though the sea -
Rather than a Mooring - unshared by thee
Ours be the Cargo - unladen - here -
Rather than the "spicy isles" -
And thou - not there -
