What if I say I shall not wait!
What if I burst the Bashful Gate
And pass escaped— to thee!
What if I file this Mortal— off—
See where It hurt me— That's enough—
And wade in Liberty!

They cannot take me— any more—
Dungeons can call— and Guns implore
Unmeaning— now— to me—

As laughter— was— an hour ago—
Or Laces— or a Travelling Show—
Or who died— yesterday!
