One Day is there of the Series
Termed Thanksgiving Day–
Celebrated part at Table,
Part in Memory.

Neither Patriarch nor Pussy,
I dissect the Play,
Seems it to my hooded thinking,
Reflex Holiday.

Had there been no sharp Subtraction
From the early Sum,
Not an Acre or a Captive
Where was once a Room–

Not a Mention, whose small Pebble
Wrinkled any Sea,
Unto such, were such Assembly,
'Twere Thanksgiving Day.
