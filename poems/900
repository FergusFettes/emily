What did They do since I saw Them?
Were They industrious?
So many questions to put Them
Have I the eagerness–

That could I snatch Their Faces–
That could Their lips reply–
Not till the last was answered
Should They start for the Sky.

Not If Their Party were waiting–
Not If to talk with Me
Were to Them now, Homesickness
After Eternity–

Not If the Just suspect me–
And offer a Reward–
Would I restore my Booty
To that Bold Person, God–
