Life— is what we make it—
Death— We do not know—
Christ's acquaintance with Him
Justify Him— though—

He— would trust no stranger—
Other— could betray—
Just HIS own endorsement—
That— sufficeth Me—

All the other DIstance
He hath traversed first—
No New MIle remaineth—
Far as ParadIse—

His sure foot preceding—
Tender Pioneer—
Base must be the Coward
Dare not venture— now—
