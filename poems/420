You'll know it– as you know 'tis Noon–
By Glory–
As you do the Sun–
By Glory–
As you will in Heaven–
Know God the Father– and the Son.

By Intuition, Mightiest Things
Assert themselves– and not by terms–
"I'm Midnight"–need the Midnight say
"I'm Sunrise"–Need the Majesty?

Omnipotence– had not a Tongue–
His LISP– IS Lightning– and the Sun–
His Conversation– With the Sea–
"How shall you know?"
Consult your Eye!
