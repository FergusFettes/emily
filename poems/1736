Proud of my broken heart, since thou didst break it—
Proud of the pain I did not feel till thee,
Proud of my night, since thou with moons dost slake it,
Not to partake thy passion, my humility.

Thou canst not boast, like Jesus, drunken without companion
Was the strong cup of anguish brewed for the Nazarene
Thou canst not pierce tradition with the peerless puncture,
See! I usurped thy crucifix to honor mine!
