'Tis whiter than an Indian Pipe—  
'Tis dimmer than a Lace—  
No stature has it, like a Fog  
When you approach the place—

Not any Voice imply It here—  
Or intimate It there—  
A spirit—how doth it accost—  
What function hath the Air?—

This limitless Hyperbole  
Each one of us shall be—  
'Tis Drama—if Hypothesis  
It be not Tragedy—
