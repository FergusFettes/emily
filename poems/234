'Tis not the swaying frame we miss,
It is the steadfast Heart
That had it beat of Symphony
Might overflow the World–

The Harps that once– could heal our pain
Withdrawn too far away
The Patience– that could never tire
Is lost, in Marble– now–

'Tis "narrow," You remember,
And "difficult the Gate,"
And "few there be"– Correct again
That "enter in– thereat"–

'Tis Costly– So are purples!
'Tis just the price of Breath,
With but the "Discount" of the Grave
Termed by the Brokers– "Death"–

And after that– there's Heaven,
The Good Man's– "Dividend"–
And Bad Men– "go to Jail," I guess.
