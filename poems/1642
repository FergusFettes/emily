"Red Sea," indeed! Talk not to me
Of purple Pharaoh–
I have a Navy in the West
Would pierce his Columns through–

Guileless, yet of such Glory fine
That all along the Line
Is it, or is it not, Marine–
Is it, or not, divine–

The Eye inquires with a sigh
That Earth should be so big–
What Exultation in the Woe–
What Wine in the fatigue!
