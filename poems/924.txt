Love - is that later Thing than Death – 
More previous - than Life – 
Confirms It at its entrance – And 
Usurps it - of itself – 

Tastes Death - the first - to hand the song – 
The Second - to its friend – 
Disarms the little interval – 
Deposits Him With God – 

Then hovers - an inferior Guard – 
Lest this Beloved Charge 
Need - once in an Eternity – 
A smaller than the Large –
