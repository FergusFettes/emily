Of Brussels– it was not–
Of Kidderminster– Nay–
The Winds did buy it of the Woods–
They– sold it unto me–

It was a gentle price–
The poorest– could afford–
It was Within the frugal purse
Of Beggar– or of Bird–

Of small and spicy Yards–
In hue– a mellow Dun–
Of Sunshine– and of Sere– Composed–
But, principally– of Sun–

The Wind– unrolled It fast–
And spread It on the Ground–
Upholsterer of the Pines– is He–
Upholsterer– of the Pond–
