My Heart ran so to thee
It would not wait for me
And I affronted grew
And drew away

For whatsoever my pace
He first achieve thy Face
How general a Grace
Allotted two

Not In malignity
Mentioned I this to thee
Had he obliquity
Soonest to share

But for the Greed of him
Boasting my Premium
Basking in Bethlehem
Ere I be there
