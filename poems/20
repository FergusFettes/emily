Distrustful of the Gentian—
And just to turn away,
The fluttering of her fringes
Chide my perfidy—

Weary for my—
Wise— I will sing no—
I shall not feel the sleet— then—
I shall not fear the snow.

Flees so the phantom meadow
Before the breathless Bee—
So bubble brooks in deserts
On Ears that dying— lie—

Burn so the Evening Spires
To Eyes that Closing— go—
Hangs so distant Heaven—
To a hand below.
