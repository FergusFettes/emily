These are the signs to Nature's inns–
Her invitation broad–
To Whosoever famishing,
To taste her mystic Bread–

These are the rites of Nature's house–
The Hospitality
That opens with an equal width
To Beggar and to Bee

For sureties of her staunch estate–
Her undecaying cheer–
The Purple in the East is set,
And in the North, the Star–
