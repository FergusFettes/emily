Color— Caste— Denomination—
These— are Time's Affair—

Death's diviner Classifying
Does not know they are—

As to sleep— All Hue forgotten—
Tenets— put behind—
Death's large— Democratic fingers
Rub away the Brand—

If Circassian— He is careless—
If He put away
Chrysalis of Blonde— or Umber—
Equal Butterfly—

They emerge from HIS Obscuring
What Death— knows so well—
Our minuter Intuitions
Deem unplausible—
