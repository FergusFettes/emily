Ourselves were wed one summer—dear—
Your Vision—was in June—
And when Your little Lifetime failed,
I weaned—too—of mine—

And overtaken in the Dark—
Where You had put me down—
By Someone carrying a light—
I—too—received the Sign.

'Tis true—Our Futures different lay—
Your Cottage—faced the sun—
While Oceans—and the North must be
On every side of mine—

'Tis true, Your Garden led the Bloom,
For mine—in Frosts—was sown—
And yet, one Summer, we were Queens—
But You—were crowned in June—
