The Frost was never seen–
If met, too rapid passed,
Or too unsubstantial team–
The Flowers not–

Ice first–
A Stranger hovering round–
A Symptom of alarm–
In Villages remotely set–

But search effaces Him–
Till some retrieveless Night–
Our Vigilance at waste–
The Garden gets the only shot–

That never could be traced–
Unproved is much we know–
Unknown the worst we fear–
Of Strangers is the Earth the Inn–

Of Secrets is the Air–
To analyze perhaps
A Phrenzy would prefer–
But Labor vaster than myself–

I find It to infer–
