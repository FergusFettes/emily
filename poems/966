All forgot for recollecting
Just a paltry One—
All forsook, for just a Stranger's
New Accompanying—

Grace of Wealth, and Grace of Station
Less accounted than
An unknown Esteem possessing—
Estimate— 'Who can—

Home effaced— Her faces dwindled—
Nature— altered small—
Sun—if shone—or Storm—if shattered—
Overlooked I all—

Dropped— my fate— a timid pebble—
In thy bolder Sea—
Prove— me— Sweet— if I regret It—
Prove Myself— of Thee—
