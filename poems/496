As far from Pity, as Complaint—
As cool to Speech—as Stone—
As numb to Revelation—
As if my Trade were Bone—

As far from Time—as History—
As near Yourself—Today—
As Children, to the Rainbow’s scarf—
Or Sunset’s Yellow play—

To eyelids in the Sepulchre—
How dumb the Dancer lies—
While Color’s Revelations break—
And blaze—the Butterflies!
