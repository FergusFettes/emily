Whatever It IS – she has tried It –
Awful Father of Love –
Is not Ours the chastising –
Do not chastise the Dove –

Not for Ourselves, we petition –
Nothing is left to pray –
When a subject IS finished –
Words are handed away –

Only lest she be lonely –
In thy beautiful House –
Give her for her Transgression –
License to think of us –

1945
