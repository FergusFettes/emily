These are the Nights that Beetles love—
From Eminent remote—
Drives— ponderous— perpendicular—
His figure intimate—

The terror of the Children—
The merriment of men—
Depositing His Thunder—
He hoists— abroad again—

A Bomb upon the Ceiling—
Is an improving thing—
It keeps the nerves progressive—
Conjecture flourishing—

Too dear the Summer evening—
Without discreet alarm—
Supplied by Entomology—
With its remaining charm—
