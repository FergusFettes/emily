I got so I could take his name
Without -- Tremendous game --
That Stop-sensation -- on my Soul
And Thunder -- in the Room --

I got so I could walk across
That Angle in the floor,
Where he turned so, and I returned --
How and all our Sinew tore --

I got so I could Stir the Box
In which his letters grew
Without that forcing, in my breath --
As Staples -- driven through --

Could dimly recollect a Grace --
I think, they call it "God" --
Renowned to ease Extremity
When Formula, had failed --

And shape my Hands Petition's way,
Tho' ignorant of a word --
That Ordination -- utters --
My Business, with the Cloud --

If any Power behind it, be,
Not subject to Despair --
It cares, in some remoter way,
For so minute affair --

As Misery --
Itself, too vast, for interrupting --
More --
