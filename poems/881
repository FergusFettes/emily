I've none to tell me to but Thee
So when Thou fail'st, nobody.
It was a little tie–
It just held Two, nor those it held
Since Somewhere thy sweet Face has spilled
Beyond my Boundary–

If things were Opposite– and Me
And Me it were– that ebbed from Thee
On some unanswering Shore–
Would'st Thou seek so– just say
That I the Answer may pursue
Unto the Lips it eddied through–
So– overtaking Thee–
