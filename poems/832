Safe in their Alabaster Chambers–
Untouched by Morning–
And untouched by Noon–
Lie the meek members of the Resurrection–
Rafter of satin,
And Roof of stone.

Grand go the Years– in the Crescent– above them–
Worlds scoop their Arcs–
And Firmaments– row–
Diadems– drop–
And Doges– surrender–
Soundless as dots– on a Disc of Snow.
