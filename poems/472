I am ashamed— I hide—
What right have I— to be a Bride—
So late a Dowerless Girl—
Nowhere to hide my dazzled Face—

No one to teach me that new Grace—
Nor introduce— my Soul—
Me to adorn— How— tell—
Trinket— to make Me beautiful—

Fabrics of Cashmere—
Never a Gown of Dun— no more—
Raiment instead— of Pompadour—
For Me— My soul— to wear—

Fingers— to frame my Round Hair
Oval— as Feudal Ladies wore—
Far Fashions— Fair—
Skill— to hold my Brow like an Earl—

Plead— like a Whippoorwill—
Prove— like a Pearl—
Then, for Character—
Except the Heaven had come so near—

So seemed to choose My Door—
The Distance would not haunt me so—
I had not hoped— before—
But just to hear the Grace depart—

I never thought to see—
Afflicts me with a Double loss—
'Tis lost— And lost to me—
