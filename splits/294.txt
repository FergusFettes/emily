The Doomed - regard the SunrISe
WIth dIfferent DelightBecause - when next it burns abroad
They doubt to WItness it The Man - to dIe - tomorrow Harks for the Meadow Bird Because its MUSIC stirs the Axe
That clamors for his head Joyful- to whom the Sunrise
Precedes Enamored - DayJoyful- for whom the Meadow Bird
Has ought but Elegy!
