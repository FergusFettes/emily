Before the ice is in the pools Before the skaters go,
Or any cheek at nightfall
Is tarnished by the snow Before the fields have finished,
Before the Christmas tree,
Wonder upon wonder
Will arrive to me!


What we touch the hems of
On a summer's dayWhat IS only walkIng
Just a brIdge awayThat whIch sings so - speaks soWhen there's no one hereWIll the frock I wept In
Answer me to wear?
