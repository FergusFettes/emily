Although I put away his lifeAn Ornament too grand
For Forehead low as mine, to wear,
This might have been the Hand
That sowed the flower, he preferredOr smoothed a homely pain,
Or pushed the pebble from his path Or played his chosen tuneOn Lute the least-the latestBut just his Ear could know

That whatsoe'er delighted it,
I never would let goThe foot to bear hIS errandA little Boot I knowWould leap abroad like AntelopeWIth just the grant to doHIS wearIest Commandment A sweeter to obey,
Than "HIde and Seek" Or skIp to FlutesOr All Day, chase the BeeYour Servant, Sir, will wearyThe Surgeon, will not comeThe World, wIll have ItS own-to doThe Dust, will vex your FameThe Cold wIll force your tightest door
Some February Day,
But say my apron bring the stIcks
To make your Cottage gayThat I may take that promise
To ParadIse, with meTo teach the Angels, avarIce,
You, Sir, taught first-to me.
