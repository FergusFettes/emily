Art thou the thing I wanted?
Begone - my Tooth has grownSupply the minor Palate
That has not starved so longI tell thee while I waited
The mystery of Food
Increased till I abjured it
And dine without Like God-

Art thou the thing I wanted?
Begone - my Tooth has grownAffront a minor palate
Thou could'st not goad so longI tell thee while I waitedThe mystery of Food
Increased till I abjured it
Subsisting now like God-
