I bring an unaccustomed wme
To hps long parchmg
Next to mme,
And summon them to drink,
Cracklmg with fever, they Essay,
I turn my brimmmg eyes away,
And come next hour to look.
The hands stIll hug the tardy gla!>~ The hps I would have cooled, alas Are so superfluous Cold-

I would as soon attempt to warm
The bosoms where the frost has lam
Ages beneath the mould Some other thirsty there may be
To whom this would have pointed me
Had it remained to speak And so I always bear the cup
If, haply, mine may be the drop
Some pIlgrim thirst to slake -

If, haply, any say to me
"Unto the little, unto me,"
When I at last awake.
