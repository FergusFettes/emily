Fitter to see Him, I may be
For the long Hindrance - Grace - to MeWith Summers, and with Winters, grow,
Some passing Year - A trait bestow
To make Me fairest of the Earth The Waiting - then - will seem so worth
I shall impute with half a pain
The blame that I was chosen - thenTime to anticipate His GazeIt's first-Delight-and then-Surprise

The turning o'er and o'er my face
For Evidence it be the GraceHe left behind One Day - So less
He seek ConvictIon, That- be This-

I only must not grow so new
That He'll mistake - and ask for me
Of me-when first unto the Door
I go - to Elsewhere go no more-

I only must not change so fair
He'll sigh - "The Other - She -IS Where)"
The Love, tho', will array me right
I shall be perfect - in His SIght -

If He perceive the other TruthUpon an Excellenter Youth How sweet I shall not lack in VamBut gain - thro' loss - Through Grief - obtain The Beauty that reward Him bestThe Beauty of Demand-at Rest-
