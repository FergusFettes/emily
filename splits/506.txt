He touched me, so I live to know
That such a day, permItted so,
I groped upon hIS breastIt was a boundless place to me
And SIlenced, as the awful sea
Puts mInor streams to rest.
And now, I'm different from before,
As if I breathed superior alrOr brushed a Royal Gown My feet, too, that had wandered soMy Gypsy face - transfigured nowTo tenderer RenownInto this Port, if I mIght come,
Rebecca, to Jerusalem,
Would not so ravished tumNor Persian, bafHed at her shrIne
Lift such a Crucifixal sign
To her imperial Sun.
