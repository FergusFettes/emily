We dream - it is good we are dreamingIt would hurt us - were we awakeBut since it is playing- kill us,
And we are playing - shriekWhat harm? Men die - externallyIt is a truth-of BloodBut we - are dying in DramaAnd Drama - is never deadCautious - We jar each otherAnd either - open the eyes

Lest the Phantasm-prove the MlstakeAnd the livid Surprise
Cool us to Shafts of GramteWIth just an Age - and Name And perhaps a phrase in EgyptianIt's prudenter- to dream
