A science - so the Savants say,
"C omparatlVe Aatomyn"
By which a single bone Is made a secret to unfold
Of some rare tenant of the mold,
Else perished In the stone So to the eye prospective led,
ThIS meekest flower of the mead
Upon a winter's day,
Stands representative in gold
Of Rose and Lily, mamfold,
And countless Butterfly!
