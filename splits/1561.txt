No Brigadier throughout the Year
So civic as the JayA Neighbor and a Warrior too
WIth shrill felrcity
Pursuing Winds that censure us
A February Day,
The Brother of the Universe
Was never blown awayThe Snow and he are intimateI've often seen them play
When Heaven looked upon us all
With such severity
I felt apology were due
To an insulted sky
Whose pompous frown was Nutriment
To their TemerityThe Pillow of this daring Head
Is pungent EvergreensHis Larder-terse and MilltantUnknown - refreshing thingsHis Character - a TonicHis Future-a DisputeUnfair an Immortality
That leaves this Neighbor out-
