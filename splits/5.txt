I have a Bird in spring
WhIch for myself doth singThe spnng decoys.
And as the summer nears And as the Rose appears,
Robin is gone.
Yet do I not repine
Knowing that Bird of mine
Though flown Learneth beyond the sea
Melody new for me
And will return.
Fast in a safer hand
Held in a truer land
Are mineAnd though they now depart,
Tell I my doubting heart
They're thine.
In a serener Bright,
In a more golden light
1 see
Each little doubt and fear,
Each little discord here
Removed.

Then wIll I not rep me,
Knowmg that BIrd or mInC
Though flown
Shall m a distant tIce
BrIght melody for me
Return.
