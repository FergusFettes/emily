I'll tell you how the Sun rose A RIbbon at a time The Steeples swam m Amethyst The news, hke Squirrels, ran The HIlls untied their Bonnets The Bobolmks - begunThen I saId softly to myself "That must have been the Sun"!
But how he set - I know not There seemed a purple stlle
That httle Yellow boys and glrlS
Were chmbing all the whlle Till when they reached the other slde,
A Dommie m Gray Put gently up the evenmg BarsAnd led the flock away
