I see thee better - m the DarkI do not need a LightThe Love of Thee - a Prism beExcelling VioletI see thee better for the Years
That hunch themselves betweenThe Miner's Lamp-sufficient beTo nullify the MmeAnd in the Grave-I see Thee bestIts little Panels be
Aglow - All ruddy - WIth the Light
I held so high, for TheeWhat need of DayTo Those whose Dark - hath so - surpassing SunIt deem it be-ContinuallyAt the Meridian?
