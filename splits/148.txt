All overgrown by cunmng moss,
All interspersed with weed,
The lIttle cage of "Currer Bell"
In qUIet "Haworth" laid.
Gathered from many wanderingsGethsemane can tell
Thro' what transportmg anguish
She reached the Asphodel!
Soft fall the sounds of Eden
Upon her puzzled ear Oh what an afternoon for Heaven,
When "Bronte" entered there!
