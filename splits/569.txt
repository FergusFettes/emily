I reckon - when I count at allFirst - Poets - Then the SunThen Summer - Then the Heaven of GodAnd then - the List is doneBut, looking back - the First so seems
To Comprehend the WholeThe Others look a needless ShowSo I write - Poets - AllTheir Summer -lasts a Solid YearThey can afford a Sun
The East - would deem extravagantAnd if the Further HeavenBe Beautiful as they prepare
For Those who worship ThemIt is too difficult a GraceTo justify the Dream
