The Frost of Death was on the Pane"Secure your Flower" said he.
Like Sailors fighting with a Leak
We fought Mortality.
Our passive Flower we held to SeaTo Mountain- To the Sun-


Yet even on his Scarlet shelf
To crawl the Frost begunWe pned him back
Ourselves we wedged
Himself and her between,
Yet easy as the narrow Snake
He forked his way along
TIll all her helpless beauty bent
And then our wrath begun We hunted him to his Ravine
We chased hIm to his Den We hated Death and hated Life
And nowhere was to goThan Sea and continent there is
A larger-it is Woe
