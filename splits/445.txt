'Twas just this tIme, last year, I died.
I know I heard the Com,
When I was carried by the FarmsIt had the Tassels onI thought how yellow it would lookWhen Richard went to millAnd then, I wanted to get out,
But something held my will.
I thought just how Red-Apples wedged
The Stubble's joints betweenAnd the Carts stoopmg round the fields
To take the Pumpkms inI wondered which would mISS me, least,
And when Thanksgivmg, came,
If Father'd multiply the platesTo make an even SumAnd would it blur the Chnstmas glee
My Stockmg hang too hIgh
For any Santa Claus to reach
The Altitude of meBut this sort, grieved myself,
And so, I thought the other way,
How just this time, some perfect year Themself, should come to me
