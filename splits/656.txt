The name-of it-is "Autumn"The hue - of it - is BloodAn Artery - upon the HillA Vein - along the RoadGreat Globules - in the AlleysAnd Oh, the Shower of StainWhen Winds - upset the Basin And spill the Scarlet Rain-


It sprinkles Bonnets - far belowIt gathers ruddy Pools Then - edrues like a Rose - awayUpon Vermilion Wheels-
