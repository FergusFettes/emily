I cannot lIve with YouIt would be LifeAnd Life IS over thereBehind the Shelf
The Sexton keeps the Key toPutting up
Our Life - His PorcelainLike a CupDiscarded of the HousewifeQuaint-or BrokeA newer Sevres pleasesOld Ones crackI could not die - with YouFor One must wait
To shut the Other's Gaze downYou-could notAnd I - Could I stand by
And see You - freezeWithout my Right of FrostDeath's privilege?
Nor could I rise-with YouBecause Your Face
Would putout Jesus' That New Grace
Glow plain - and foreign
On my homesick EyeExcept that You than He
Shone closer byThey'd judge Us-HowFor You-served Heaven-You know,
Or sought toI could notBecause Y01.l satura~ SightAnd I had no more.Ey~

For sordid excellence
As Paradise
And were You lost, I would beThough My Name
Rang loudest
On the Heavenly fameAnd were You - savedAnd I - condemned to be
Where You were notThat self-were Hell to MeSo We must meet apartYou there-I-hereWIth just the Door ajar
That Oceans are - and PrayerAnd that White SustenanceDespairC
