An awful Tempest mashed the air The clouds were gaunt, and fewA Black - as of a Spectre's Cloak
Hid Heaven and Earth from view.
The creatures chuckled on the Roofs And whistled 10 the air And shook their fists And gnashed their teeth And swung their frenzied hair.
The morning lit - the Birds arose The Monster's faded eyes
Turned slowly to his native coastAnd peace - was Paradisel
