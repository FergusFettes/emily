There is a Languor of the Life
More imminent than Pain'Tis Pain's Successor- When the Soul
Has suffered all it can A Drowsiness - diffuses A Dimness like a Fog
Envelops Consciousness As Mists - obliterate a Crag.
The Surgeon - does not blanch - at pain His Habit-is severe-


But tell him that It ceased to feelThe Creature lymg thereAnd he will tell you - skIll IS late A MIghtIer than HeHas mimstered before HlmThere's no Vitality.
