I think I was enchanted
'\Â¥hen first a sombre GirlI read that Foreign LadyThe Dark-felt beautifulAnd whether it was noon at nightOr only Heaven-at NoonFor very Lunacy of Light
I had not power to tellThe Bees- became as ButterfliesThe ButterflIes - as SwansApproached - and spurned the narrOw GrassAnd just the meanest Tunes
That Nature murmured to herself
To keep herself In CheerI took for GIants - practIsing
TItanic OperaThe Days - to Mighty Metres steptThe Homeliest - adorned
As if unto a Jubilee
'Twere suddenly confirmedI could not have defined the changeConversion of the Mind
Like Sanctifying in the SoulIs witnessed - not explained'Twas a Divine InsanityThe Danger to be Sane
Should I again experience'Tis Antidote to tumTo Tornes of solid WitchcraftMagicians be asleepBut Magic - hath an Element
Like DeIty - to keep
