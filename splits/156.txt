You love me - you are sure I shall not fear mistake I shall not cheated wake Some grinning morn To find the Sunnse leftAnd Orchards - unbereft And Dollie - gone l

I need not start - you're sure That night will never be When frightened - home to Thee I run To find the windows darkAnd no more Dollie - mark Quite none?

Be sure you're SUle - you know I'll bear it better now If you'll just tell me so Than when - a little dull Balm grown Over this pain of mine You stmg - again'
