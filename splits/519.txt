'Twas warm - at first -like UsUntil there crept upon

A Chill-like frost upon a GlassTill all the scene- be gone.

The Forehead copied StoneThe Fingers grew too cold
To ache-and like a Skater's BrookThe busy eyes - congealedIt straightened- that was allIt crowded Cold to ColdIt multiplied indifferenceAs Pride were all it couldAnd even when with Cords'Twas lowered, lIke a WeightIt made no Signal, nor demurred,
But dropped like Adamant.
