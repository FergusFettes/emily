To fight aloud, is very braveBut gallanter, I know
Who charge withIn the bosom
The Cavalry of WoeWho WIn, and nations do not see Who fall- and none observe Whose dyIng eyes, no Country
Regards with patriot love We trust, in plumed procession
For such, the Angels go Rang after Rank, with even feetAnd Uniforms of Snow.
