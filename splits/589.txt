The Night was wide, and furnished scant
With but a single StarThat often as a Cloud it metBlew out itself - for fear The Wind pursued the little Bush And drove away the Leaves
November left-then clambered up
And fretted in the EavesNo Squirrel went abroadA Dog's belated feet
Like intermittent Plush, he heard
Adown the empty Street-

To feel if Blinds be fastAnd closer to the fireHer little Rocking Chair to drawAnd shiver for the PoorThe Housewife's gentle TaskHow pleasanter - said she


Unto the Sofa oppositeThe Sleet - than May, no Thee
