I got so I could take his name Without - Tremendous gamThat Stop-sensation - on my SoulAnd Thunder - in the Room I got so I could walk across
That Angle in the floor,
Where he turned so, and r turned - .how And all our Sinew tore 

I got so I could Stir the Box In which hIs letters grew
WIthout that forcing, in my breathAs Staples - dnven through Could dImly recollect a Grace -

I thmk, they call it "God" Renowned to ease ExtremItyWhen Formula, had failed And shape my Hands Petition's way,
Tho' ignorant of a word
That Ordination - utters My Busmess, with the Cloud,
If any Power behmd it, be,
Not subject to DespairIt care, in some remoter way,
For so minute affair
As MiseryItself, too vast, for interruptmg - mOle -
