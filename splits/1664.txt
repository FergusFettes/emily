I did not reach Thee
But my feet slip nearer every day
Three Rivers and a HIll to cross
One Desert and a Sea
I shall not count the journey one
When I am telling thee.


Two deserts, but the Year IS cold
So that will help the sand
One desert crossedThe second one
Will feel as cool as land
Sahara is too little price
To pay for thy Right hand.
The Sea comes last- Step merry, feet,
So short we have to goTo play together we are prone,
But we must labor now,
The last shall be the lightest load
That we have had to draw.
The Sun goes crookedThat is NIght
Before he makes the bend
We must have passed the Middle Sea Almost we wish the End
Were further offToo great It seems
So near the Whole to stand.
We step like Plush,
We stand like snow,
The waters murmur new.
Three rivers and the HIll are passedTwo deserts and the sea'
Now Death usurps my Premium
And gets the look at Thee.
