I'm the lIttle "Heart's Ease"l
I don't care for pouting skIes!
If the Butterfly delay
Can I, therefoIe, stay away?

If the Coward Bumble Bee
In hIs chImney cornel stay,
I, must resoluter be'
Who'll apologrze for me?
Dear, Old fashioned, little Hower!
Eden IS old fashIoned, tool
Birds are antIquated fellows'
Heaven does not change her blue
Nor WIll I, the lIttle Heart's Ease Ever be mduced to do!
