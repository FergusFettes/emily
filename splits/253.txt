You see I cannot see - your lIfetime I must guess How many times it ache for me - today - Confess How many times for my far sake
The brave eyes film But I guess guessing hurts Mine - get so dim'
Too vague - the face My own - so patient - coversToo far - the strength My timidness enfolds Haunting the HeartLike her translated faces Teasing the want It - only - can suffice'
