She lay as if at play
Her life had leaped awayIntendmg to returnBut not so soonHer merry Arms, half droptAs if for lull of sportAn instant had forgotThe Trick to startHer dancing Eyes- ajarAs if their Owner were
Still sparkling through
For fun - at youHer Morning at the doorDeVIsing, I am sureTo force her sleepSo light - so deep
