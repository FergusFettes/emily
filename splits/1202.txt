The Frost was never seenIf met, too rapid passed,
Orm too unsubstantial TeamThe Flowers notIce first
A Stranger hovermg round
A Symptom of alarm
In Villages remotely set
But search effaces hIm
TIll some retrieveless NIght
Our VIgilance at waste
The Garden gets the only shot
That never could be traced
Unproved is much we knowUnknown the worst we fearOf Strangers is the Earth the Inn
Of Secrets IS the AirTo analyze perhaps
A Philip would prefer
But Labor vaster than myself
I find It to infer.
