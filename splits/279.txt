TIe the StrIngs to my LIfe, My Lord,
Then, I am ready to go!
Just a look at the HorsesRapId! That wIll do!
Put me m on the firmest sIde So I shall never fallFor we must ride to the JudgmentAnd it's partly, down HIllBut never I mind the steepest And never I mmd the Sea Held fast m Everlastmg RaceBy my own ChOIce, and Thee Goodbye to the Life I used to bve And the W orId I used to know And kiss the Hills, for me, just once Then - I am ready to go!
