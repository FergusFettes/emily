In Winter in my Room
I came upon a WormPink, lank and warmBut as he was a worm
And worms presume
Not quite With him at homeSecured him by a string
To something neighbormg
And went along.
A Trifle afterward
A thing occurred
I'd not believe it If I heard
But state with creeping bloodA snake with mottles rare
Surveyed my chamber floor
In feature as the worm before
But ringed WIth power-


The very string with which
I tied him - too
When he was mean and new
That string was thereI shrank - "How falr you are"!
Propitiation's claw"Afraid," he hissed
"Of me"?
"No cordiality"He fathomed meThen to a Rhythm Slim
Secreted In his Form
As Patterns swim
Projected him.
That time I Hew
Both eyes hls way
Lest he pursue
Nor ever ceased to run
Till in a distant Town
Towns on from mine
I set me down
This was a dream.
