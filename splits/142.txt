Whose are the little beds, I asked
Which in the valleys lie?
Some shook their heads, and others smiledAnd no one made reply.
Perhaps they did not hear, I said,
I will inquire again Whose are the beds - the tiny beds
So thick upon the plain?
'Tis Daisy, in the shortest A little further on -


Nearest the door - to wake the IstLittle Leontodon.
'TIS Iris, Sir, and AsterAnemone, and Bell Bartsia, in the blanket red And chubby DaffodIl.
Meanwhile, at many cradles
Her busy foot she plIed Hummmg the quaintest lullaby
That ever rocked a child.
Hush! Epigea wakens!
The Crocus stirs her lids Rhodora's cheek is crimson,
She's dreaming of the woods!
Then turning from them reverent TheIr bedtime 'tis, she saIdThe Bumble bees WIll wake them
When April woods are red.
