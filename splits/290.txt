Of Bronze - and Blaze The North - TonightSo adequate - it forms 

So preconcerted with ItselfSo dIstant - to alarmsAn Unconcern so sovereign
To U mverse, or meInfects my sImple spirit
WIth Tamts of MajestyTill I take vaster attitudesAnd strut upon my stem Disdammg Men, and Oxygen,
For Arrogance of them My Splendors, are Menageue But theIr Competeless Show
WIll entertain the Centuries
When I, am long ago,
An Island in dishonored Grass Whom none but Beetles - know
