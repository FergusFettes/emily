W'ho occupies this House?
A Stranger I must judge
Since No one knows His Circumstance'Tis well the name and age
Are writ upon the Door
Or I should fear to pause
Where not so much as Honest Dog
Approach encourages.

It seems a curious TownSome Houses very old,
Some - newly raised this Afternoon,
Were I compelled to build


It should not be among
Inhabitants so stIll
But where the BIrds assemble
And Boys were possIble.
Before Myself was born
'Twas settled, so they say,
A Territory for the Ghosts And Squirrels, formerly.
Until a PIoneer, as
Settlers often do
likIng the quiet of the Place
Attracted more untoAnd from a Settlement
A Capital has grown
DIstInguished for the gravity
Of every CItizen.
The Owner of this House
A Stranger He must beEternity's AcquaIntances
Are mostly so - to me.
