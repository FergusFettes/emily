I started Early- Took my DogAnd visited the SeaThe MermaIds in the Basement
Came out to look at meAnd Frigates-in the Upper Floor
Extended Hempen HandsPresuming Me to be a MouseAground - upon the SandsBut no Man moved Me - till the Tide
Went past my simple ShoeAnd past my Apron - and my Belt
And past my Bodice - tooAnd made as He would eat me upAs wholly as a Dew
Upon a Dandelion's SleeveAnd then - I started - tooAnd He - He followed - close behindI felt His Silver Heel
Upon my Ankle- Then my Shoes
Would overflow with Pearl-


Untll We met the Solid TownNo One He seemed to knowAnd bowing - with a MIghty lookAt me - The Sea withdrewc 1862
