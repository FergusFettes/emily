'Twas Crisis - All the length had passed That dull- benumbing tlme
There is in Fever or EventAnd now the Chance had comeThe instant holding in its claw
The pnvilege to live
Or warrant to report the Soul
The other side the Grave.
The Muscles grappled as wlth leads
That would not let the WillThe Spirit shook the AdamantBut could not make it feel.
The Second poised - debated - shotAnother had begunAnd Simultaneously, a Soul
Escaped the House unseenI945
