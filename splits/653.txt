Of Being is a Bird
The likest to the Down
An Easy Breeze do put afloat
The General Heavens - upon -

It soars - and shifts - and whirlsAnd measures with the Clouds
In easy - even - dazzling paceNo different the BirdsExcept a Wake of Music
Accompany their feetAs did the Down emit a TuneFor Ecstasy - ofit
