I know a place where Summer strives
Wlth such a practised FrostShe - each year -leads her Daisies backRecordmg briefly - "Lost" But when the South Wind stirs the Pools
And struggles in the lanesHer Heart misgives Her, for Her VowAnd she pours soft Refrains
Into the lap of AdamantAnd spices - and the Dew-


That stIffens qUletly to QuartzUpon her Amber Shoe
