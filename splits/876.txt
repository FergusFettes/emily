It was a Grave, yet bore no Stone
Enclosed 'twas not of RaIl
A Consciousness its Acre, and
I t held a Human Soul.
Entombed by whom, for what offence
If Home or Foreign bornHad I the curiosity
'Twere not appeased of men
TIll ResurrectIon, I must guess
Denied the small desire
A Rose upon its RIdge to sow
Or take away a Briar.
