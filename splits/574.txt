My first well Day - since many illI asked to go abroad,
And take the Sunshine in my hands,
And see the things in PodA'blossom just when I went in
To take my Chance with painUncertain if myself, or He,
Should prove the strongest One.
The Summer deepened. while we stroveShe put some flowers awayAnd Redder cheeked Ones - in their steadA fond-illusive wayTo cheat Herself, it seemed she triedAs if before a child

To fade - Tomorrow - Rainbows held
The Sepulchre, could hide
She dealt a fashIon to the NutShe tied the Hoods to SeedsShe dropped bright scraps of T mt, aboutAnd left Brazilian Threads
On every shoulder that she metThen both her Hands of Haze
Put up - to hIde her parting Grace
From our unfitted eyes
My loss, by sIckness - Was it Loss?
Or that Ethereal Gam
One earns by measuring the GraveThen - measuring the Sun
