We do not play on GravesBecause there isn't RoomBesIdes -It isn't even - it slants
And People comeAnd put a Flower on itAnd hang their faces soWe're fearing that their Hearts will drop And crush our pretty playAnd so we move as far
As Enemies- away-


Just looking round to see how far
It is - Occasionally
