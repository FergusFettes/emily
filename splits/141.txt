Some, too fragIle for WInter winds
The thoughtful grave encloses Tenderly tuckIng them In from frost
Before their feet are cold.
Never the treasures in her nest
The cautIous grave exposes,
Building where schoolboy dare not look,
And sportsman is not bold.
The covert have all the children
Early aged, and often cold,
Sparrows, unnoticed by the Father Lambs for whom time had not a fold.
