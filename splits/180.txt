As if some little Arctic flower
Upon the polar hem Went wandering down the Latitudes
Until It puzzled came
To continents of summerTo firmaments of sunTo strange, bnght crowds of RowersAnd birds, of foreign tongue!
I say, As if thIs lIttle Rower
To Eden, wandered in What then? Why nothing,
Only, your inference therefrom!
