The Moon was but a Chin of Gold
A Night or two agoAnd now she turns Her perfect Face
Upon the World belowHer Forehead is of Amplest BlondeHer Cheek - a Beryl hewnHer Eye unto the Summer Dew
The likest I have knownHer Lips of Amber never partBut what must be the smile
Upon Her Friend she could confer
Were such Her Silver WillAnd what a privilege to be
But the remotest StarFor Certainty She take Her Way
Beside Your Palace DoorHer Bonnet is the FirmamentThe Universe-Her Shoe

The Stars- the TrInkets at Her BeltHer DImIties - of Blue
