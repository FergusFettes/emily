Musicians wrestle everywhere All day - among the crowded aIr
I hear the silver strife And - waking -long before the morn Such transport breaks upon the town
I think it that "New Life"!
It is not Bird - it has no nest Nor "Band" - in brass and scarlet - drestNor Tamborin - nor Man It IS not Hymn from pulpIt read The "Morning Stars" the Treble led
On Time's first Afternoon!
Some - say - it IS "the Spheres" - at play!
Some say that bright MajOrity
Of vanished Dames - and Men!
Some - think it service in the place
Where we - with late - celestial face Please God - shall Ascertain!
