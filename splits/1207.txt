He preached upon "Breadth" tIll it argued him narrowThe Broad are too broad to define
And of "Truth" untIl it proclaImed him a liarThe Truth never Haunted a SlgnSImpliCIty fled from his counterfeit presence

As Gold the Pyrites would shunWhat confUSIon would cover the innocent Jesus
To meet so enabled a Man!
