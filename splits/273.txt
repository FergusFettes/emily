He put the Belt around my life I heard the Buckle snap And turned away, imperial,
My Lifetime folding upDeliberate, as a Duke would do
A Kingdom's Title Deed

Henceforth, a Dedlcated sort A Member of the Cloud.
Yet not too far to come at call And do the little Toils
That make the CircUlt of the Rest And deal occasional smiles
To lIves that stoop to notice mine And kindly ask it in Whose InVItation, know you not
For Whom I must decline?
