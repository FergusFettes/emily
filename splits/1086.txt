What Twigs We held byOh tbeVIew
When Life's swift RIver strIven through
We pause before a further plunge
To take MomentumAs the Fringe
Upon a former Garment shows
The Garment cast,
Our Props dIsclose
So scant, so eminently small
Of Might to help, so pitiful
To sink, If We had labored, fond
The dIligence were not more blmd
How scant, by everlasting Light
The Discs that satisfied Our SightHow dimmer than a Saturn's Bar
The Things esteemed, for Thmgs that are!
