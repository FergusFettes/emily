God made a little GentianIt tried - to be a RoseAnd failed-and all the Summer laughedBut just before the Snows

There rose a Purple CreatureThat ravished all the HIlIAnd Summer hid her ForeheadAnd Mockery - was stillThe Frosts were her conditIOn The T yrian would not come
Until the North-mvoke ItCreator - Shall I - bloom?
