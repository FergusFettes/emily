If you were coming in the Fall,
I'd brush the Summer by
WIth half a smile, and half a spurn,
As Housewives do, a Fly.

If I could see you in a year,
I'd wmd the months in ballsAnd put them each in separate Drawers,
For fear the numbers fuse-

If only Centuries, delayed,
I'd count them on my Hand,
Subtracting, tIll my fingers dropped
Into Van Dieman's Land.

If certain, when this life was outThat yours and mine, should be
I'd toss it yonder, hke a Rind,
And take EternityBut, now, uncertain of the length
Of this, that is between,

It goads me, lIke the Goblm BeeThat will not state - its sang.
