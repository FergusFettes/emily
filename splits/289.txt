I know some lonely Houses off the Road
A Robber'd like the look of Wooden barred,
And Wmdows hanging low,
Inviting to A Portico,
Where two could creep One - hand the Tools The other peep To make sure All's Asleep 

Old fashioned eyes Not easy to surprise!
How orderly the Kltchen'd look, by night,
WIth just a ClockBut they could gag the TIck And MIce won't bark And so the Walls - don't tellNone-willA paIr of Spectacles ajar just stlrAn Almanac's aware Was It the Mat - winked,
Or a Nervous Star?
The Moon - slIdes down the staIr,
To see who's there!
There'!, plunder - whereTankard, or SpoonEarrmg - or Stone A Watch - Some AnCIent Brooch
To match the Grandmama Staid sleepmg - there Day - rattles - too
Stealth's - slowThe Sun has got as far
As the third SycamoreScreams Chanticleer
'Who's there"?
And Echoes - Trains away,
Sneer - 'Where"!
While the old Couple, just astir,
Fancy the Sunrise -left the door ajar!
