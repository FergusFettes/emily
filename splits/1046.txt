I've dropped my Brain - My Soul is numbThe Veins that used to run
Stop palsied - 'tis Paralysis
Done perfecter on stone


VItality is Carved and cool.
My nerve In Marble liesA Breathing "Toman
Yesterday - Endowed with Paradise.
Not dumb- I had a sort that moved-

A Sense that smote and stirred Instincts for Dance - a caper part-

An Aptitude for BirdWho wrought Carrara in me
And chiselled all my tune
Were it a WItchcraft-were it DeathI've still a chance to strain
To Being, somewhere - Motion - Breath Though Centuries beyond,
And every limit a DecadeI'll shiver, satisfied.
