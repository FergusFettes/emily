There is another sky,
Evel serene and fair,
And there is another sunshme,
Though it be darkness thel e;
Never mind faded forests, Austin,
Never mind silent fields Here is a little forest,
Whose leaf is ever green;
Here IS a brightel garden,
Where not a frost has been;
In its unfading flowers
I hear the bright bee hum;
Prithee, my brother,
Into my garden come!
