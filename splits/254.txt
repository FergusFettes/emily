"Hope" is the thing with feathers That perches In the soul And sings the tune Without the words And never stops - at allAnd sweetest - in the Gale - is heard And sore must be the storm That could abash the little Bird
That kept so many warm I've heard it in the chillest landAnd on the strangest Sea Yet, never, in Extremity,
It asked a crumb - of Me.
