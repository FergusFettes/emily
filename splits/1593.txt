There came a Wind like a BugleIt quivered through the Grass


And a Green Chill upon the Heat
So ominous dId pass
We barred the Windows and the Doors
As from an Emerald GhostThe Doom's electric Moccasin
That very instant passedOn a strange Mob of panting Trees
And Fences fled away
And Rivers where the Houses ran
Those looked that lived - that DayThe Bell wIthin the steeple wild
The Hymg tidmgs toldHow much can come
And much can go,
And yet abIde the World!
