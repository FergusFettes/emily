Sweet - You forgot - but I remembered
Every time - for TwoSo that the Sum be never hindered
Through Decay of YouSay if I erred? Accuse my FarthmgsBlame the little Hand
Happy It be for You-a Beggar'sSeekmg More - to spendJust to be Rich - to waste my Guineas
On so Best a HeartJust to be Poor-for Barefoot Vision
You - Sweet - Shut me out C
