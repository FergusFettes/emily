Good Night l Which put the Candle out';)
A jealous Zephyr - not a doubt Ah, friend, you little knew
How long at that celestial wick
The Angels - labored diligentExtinguished - now - for you!
It might - have been the LIght House sparkSome SaIlor - rowmg in the Dark Had importuned to seel
It might - have been the waning lamp
That ht the Drummer from the Camp
To purer ReveIlle!
