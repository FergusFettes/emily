He fought lIke those Who've nought to loseBestowed HImself to Balls
As One who for a further Life
Had not a further UseInvited Death - with bold attemptBut Death was Coy of Him
As Other Men, were Coy of Death To Him-to live-was DoomHIS Comrades, shifted like the Flakes
When Gusts reverse the SnowBut He - was left alive Because
Of Greediness to die1935
