The Gentian has a parched CorollaLike azure dried
'Tis Nature's buoyant juices
BeatifiedWithout a vaunt or sheen
As casual as Rain
And as benign When most is past - it comesNor isolate it seems
Its Bond its FriendTo fill its Fringed career
And aid an aged Year
Abundant endIts lot-were it forgotThis Truth endear-


Fidelity IS gain
Creation o'er
