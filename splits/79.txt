GOIng to Heaven!
I don't know whenPray do not ask me how!
Indeed I'm too astonished
To thInk of answering you!
GOIng to Heaven!
How dlm It sounds!
And yet it wlll be done
As sure as flocks go home at mght
Unto the Shepherd's arm!
Perhaps you're gomg too!
Who knows?
If you should get there first
Save just a little space for me
Close to the two I lost The smallest "Robe" will fit me
And just a bit of "Crown" For you know we do not mInd our dress
When we are going home I'm glad I don't belIeve it
For it would stop my breath And I'd like to look a little more
At such a CUrIOUS Earthl
I'm glad they did believe it
Whom I have never found
Since the mighty Autumn afternoon
I left them in the ground.
