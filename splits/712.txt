Because I could not stop for DeathHe kindly stopped for meThe Carriage held but just OurselvesAnd Immortality.
We slowly drove - He knew no haste
And I had put away
My labor and my leisure too,
For HIS CivilityWe passed the School, where Children strove
At Recess - In the RmgWe passed the Fields of Gazmg Gram We passed the Settmg SunOrrather - He passed UsThe Dews drew qUIvering and chillFor only Gossamer, my GownMy TIppet-only TulleWe paused before a House that seemed
A Swelling of the GroundThe Roof was scarcely visibleThe Cornice - in the GroundSince then - 'tis Centuries - and yet
Feels shorter than the Day
I first sunnised the Horses' Heads
Were toward Eternity
