From Cocoon forth a Butterfly
As Lady from her Door
Emerged - a Summer AfternoonRepairing EverywhereWIthout Design - that I could trace
Except to stray abroad
On MIscellaneous Enterpnse
The Clovers - understood Her pretty Parasol be seen
Contractmg in a FIeld
Where Men made HayThen struggling hard
With an opposing CloudWhere PartIes - Phantom as HerselfTo Nowhere-seemed to go
In purposeless CircumferenceAs 'twere a Tropic ShowAnd notwIthstanding Bee-that wOlkedAnd Flower- that zealous blewThlS AudIence of Idleness
Disdained them, from the SkyTill Sundown crept - a steady TideAnd Men that made the HayAnd Afternoon - and ButterflyExtinguished - in the Sea
