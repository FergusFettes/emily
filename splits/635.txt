I think the longest Hour of all
Is when the Cars have comeAnd we are waiting for the Coach It seems as though the Time
Indignant - that the Joy was comeDid block the Gilded HandsAnd would not let the Seconds byBut slowest instant - endsThe Pendulum begins to countLike lIttle Scholars -loudThe steps grow thicker - in the HallThe Heart begins to crowdThen I - my timid service doneTho' service 'twas, of LoveTake up my little ViolinAnd further North-remove.
