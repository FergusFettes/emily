Our little Kinsmen - after Rain
In plenty may be seen,
A Pink and Pulpy multItude
The tepid Ground upon
A needless life, it seemed to me
Until a little BIrd
As to a Hospitality
Advanced and breakfasted.
As I of He, so God of Me
I pondered, may have Judged,
And left the little Angle Worm
With Modesties enlarged.
