I gave myself to HimAnd took Himself, for Pay,
The solemn contract of a Life
Was ratified, this wayThe Wealth might disappointMyself a poorer prove
Than this great Purchaser suspect,
The Daily Own - of Love
Depreciate the VisionBut till the Merchant buy-


Still Fable - In the Isles of SpIceThe subtle Cargoes -lieAt least- 'tis Mutual- RiskSome-found it-Mutual GamSweet Debt of Life - Each Night to oweInsolvent-every Noon
