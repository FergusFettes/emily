The Sunrise runs for Both The East - Her Purple Troth
Keeps with the HillThe Noon unwinds Her Blue
Till One Breadth cover TwoRemotest - stillNor does the NIght forget
A Lamp for Each - to setWICks wide awayThe North - Her blazing Sign
Erects in IodineTill Both - can seeThe Midnight's Dusky Arms
Clasp Hemispheres, and Homes
And so
Upon Her Bosom-OneAnd One upon Her HemBoth lie
