Delayed till she had ceased to know Delayed till in its vest of snow
Her lOving bosom lay -


An hour behind the fleetmg breath Later by just an hour than Death Oh lagging Yesterday!
Could she have guessed that It would be Could but a crier of the joy
Have climbed the dIstant hl11Had not the bliss so slow a pace
Who knows but this surrendered face
Were undefeated snll'
Oh If there may departIng be
Any forgot by VIctOry
In her Imperial round Show them this meek appareled thing
That could not stop to be a kmg Doubtful if It be crowned!
