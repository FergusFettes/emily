To die - takes just a little whileThey say it doesn't hurt-


It's only famter - by degreesAnd then - it's out of sIghtA darker Ribbon - for a DayA Crape upon the Hat And then the pretty sunshme comes And helps us to forget The absent - mystIc - creature That but for love of us Had gone to sleep - that soundest time WIthout the weariness
