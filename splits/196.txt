We don't cry- Tun and I,
Weare far too grand But we bolt the door tight
To prevent a friendThen we hide our brave face
Deep in our hand Not to cry - Tim and I We are far too grand Nor to dream - he and meDo we condescend We just shut our brown eye
To see to the endTim - see Cottages But, Oh, so high!
Then - we shake - TIm and I And lest I - cry Tim - reads a little Hymn And we both pray -


Please, SIr, I and TlmAlways lost the way'
We must dle - by and byClergymen say Tlm - shall- if I - doI-too-lfheHow shall we arrange It Tlm - was - so - shy,;!
Take us slmultaneous - LordI - "Tim" - and - Me'
