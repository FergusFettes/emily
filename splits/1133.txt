The Snow that never driftsThe transient, fragrant snow
That comes a single time a Year
Is softly drIving nowSo thorough in the Tree
At night beneath the star
That it was February's Foot
Experience would swearLike Winter as a Face
We stern and former knew
Repaired of all but Loneliness
By Nature's AlibiWere every stonn so spice
The Value could not beWe buy with contrast - Pang is good
As near as memory-
