Two Butterflies went out at NoonAnd waltzed upon a FarmThen stepped straight through the Firmament
And rested, on a Beam

And then - together bore away
Upon a shining SeaThough never yet, in any PortTherr coming, mentloned- be-

If spoken by the distant BrrdIf met in Ether Sea
By Frigate, or by MerchantmanNo notice-was-to me
