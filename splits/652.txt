A Prison gets to be a friendBetween its Ponderous face
And Ours - a Kinsmanship expressAnd in its narrow EyesWe come to look with gratitude
For the appointed Beam
It deal us - stated as our foodAnd hungered for - the sameWe learn to know the PlanksThat answer to Our feetSo miserable a sound - at firstNor ever now - so sweet-

As plashing in the PoolsWhen Memory was a BoyBut a Demurer CircuitA Geometric Joy

The Posture of the Key
That interrupt the Day
To Our Endeavor - Not so real
The Cheek of LibertyAs this Phantasm SteelWhose features - Day and NightAre present to us - as Our OwnAnd as escapeless - quiteThe narrow Round - the StintThe slow exchange of Hope For something passiver - Content
Too steep for looking upThe LIberty we knew
Avoided -like a DreamToo wIde for any Night but HeavenIf That - indeed - redeem-
