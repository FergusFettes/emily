The Black Berry - wears a Thorn in his sideBut no Man heard Him cryHe offers His Berry, just the same
To Partridge - and to BoyHe sometimes holds upon the FenceOr struggles to a Tree

Or clasps a Rock, with both His HandsBut not for Sympathy-

We-tell a Hurt-to cool itThis Mourner - to the Sky
A little further reaches - insteadBrave Black Berry
