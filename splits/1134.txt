The Wind took up the Northern Things
And piled them in the south-


Then gave the East unto the West
And opening his mouth
The four Divisions of the Earth
DId make as to devour
WhIle everything to corners slunk
Behmd the awful powerThe Wind- unto his Chambers went
And nature ventured outHer subjects scattered into place
Her systems ranged about
Again the smoke from Dwellings rose
The Day abroad was heardHow intimate, aT empest past
