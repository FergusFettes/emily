Three tImes - we parted - Breath - and I Three times - He would not goBut strove to stIr the lifeless Fan
The Waters - strove to stay.
Three Times - the Billows tossed me upThen caught me - hke a BaIlThen made Blue faces in my faceAnd pushed away a sail
That crawled Leagues off-I liked to seeFor thinking - while I dieHow pleasant to behold a Thing
Where Human faces - beThe Waves grew sleepy - Breath - did notThe Wmds-like ChIldren-lulledThen Sunrise kissed my ChrysalIsAnd I stood up - and lived
