It was a quiet wayHe asked if I was hisI made no answer of the Tongue
But answer of the EyesAnd then He bore me on
Before this mortal nOIse
WIth swiftness, as of Chariots
And distance, as of Wheels.
This World did drop away
As Acres from the feet
Of one that leaneth from Balloon
Upon an Ether street.
The Gulf behind was not,
The Continents were newEternIty it was before
Eternity was due.
No Seasons were to usIt was not Night nor MornBut Sunrise stopped upon the place
And fastened it in Dawn.
