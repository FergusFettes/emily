My Life had stood - a Loaded GunIn Corners - tIll a Day
The Owner passed - identifiedAnd carried Me awayAnd now We roam in Sovereign WoodsAnd now We hunt the DoeAnd every time I speak for HimThe Mountains straight replyAnd do I smile, such cordial light
Upon the Valley glowIt is as a Vesuvian face
Had let its pleasure throughAnd when at Night-Our good Day doneI guard My Master's Head'Tis better than the Eider-Duck's
Deep Pillow - to have sharedTo foe of His - I'm deadly foeNone stir the second timeOn whom Ilaya Yellow EyeOr an emphatic ThumbThough I than He - may longer live
He longer must - than 1

For I haye but the power to kIll,
\V lthout - the power to dIe-
