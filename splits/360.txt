Death sets a Thing significant
The Eye had hurried by

Except a perished Creature
Entreat us tenderly
To ponder little Workmanships
In Crayon, or in Wool,
With "This was last Her fingers chd" Industrious untilThe ThImble weighed too heavyThe stItches stopped - themselvesAnd then 'twas put among the Dust
Upon the Closet shelvesA Book I have - a friend gaveWhose Pencil- here and thereHad notched the place that pleased HimAt Rest - HIs fingers areNow-when I read-I read notFor mterruptmg TearsObhterate the Etchings
Too Costly for Repairs.
