The Fingers of the Light
Tapped soft upon the Town
With "I am great and cannot wait
So therefore let me in."
"You're soon," the Town replied,
"My Faces are asIeepBut swear, and I willIet you by,
You will not wake them up."
The easy Guest complied

But once within the Town
The transport of His Countenance
Awakened Maid and Man
The Neighbor In the Pool
Upon HIS Hip elate
Made loud obeisance and the Gnat
Held up His Cup for Light.
