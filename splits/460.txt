I know where Wells grow - Droughtless WellsDeep dug - for Summer daysWhere Mosses go no more awayAnd Pebble - safely playsIt's made of Fathoms - and a BeltA Belt of jagged StoneInlaid with Emerald - half way down And Diamonds - jumbled onIt has no Bucket- Were I rich
A Bucket I would buyI'm often thirsty - but my lips
Are so high up- You seeI read in an Old fashioned Book
That P eopIe "thÂ·II'st no more" The Wells have Buckets to them thereIt must mean that - I'm sureShall We remember Parching-then?
Those Waters sound so grandI think a litde Well-like MineDearer to understand-
