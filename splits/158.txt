Dying! Dying in the night!
Won't somebody bring the light
So I can see which way to go
Into the everlasting snow?
And "Jesus"! Where is Jesus gone?
They said that Jesus - always came -


Perhaps he doesn't know the House ThIs way, Jesus, Let hIm pass'
Somebody run to the great gate
And see If Dolhe's commg! Wait!
I hear her feet upon the stair!
Death won't hurt - now Dolhe's here!
