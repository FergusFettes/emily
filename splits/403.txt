In sendmg all the BIrds awayAnd movmg mto PodMyself - for scarcely settled The Phoebes have begunAnd then-It's tIme to strike my TentAnd open House - again It's mostly, interruptionsMy Summel - is despolledBecause there was a Wmter-onceAnd all the Cattle - starved!.And so there was a DelugeAnd swept the World awayBut Ararat's a Legend-nowAnd no one credits Noah
