A Lady red - amid the Hill
Her annual secret keeps!
A Lady white, within the Field
In placid Lily sleeps!

The tidy Breezes, with their Brooms Sweep vale - and hIll- and tree'
Pnthee, My pretty Housewives'
Who may expected be'
The Neighbors do not yet suspect!
The Woods exchange a smile!
Orchard, and Buttercup, and Bird In such a lIttle while!
And yet, how stIll the Landscape stands'
How nonchalant the Hedge!
As if the "ResurrectIOn"
Were nothmg very strange!
