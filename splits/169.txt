In Ebon Box, when years have flown
To reverently peer,
WIping away the velvet dust
Summers have sprmkled there!
To hold a letter to the lIghtGrown Tawny now, with tnne To con the faded syllables
That quickened us like WIne!
Perhaps a Flower's shrivelled cheek
Among its stores to find Plucked far away, some morning By gallant - mouldering hand!
A curl, perhaps, from foreheads
Our Constancy forgot Perhaps, an Antique trinket In vanished fashions set!
And then to lay them quiet back And go about its care As if the little Ebon Box
Were none of aur affair!
