I showed her Heights she never saw'Would'st Climb," I said?
She said- "Not so"'With me -" I said - With me?
I showed her Secrets - Morning's NestThe Rope the Nights were put acrossAnd now - 'Would'st have me for a Guest?"


She could not find her YesAnd then, I brake my life - And Lo,
A Light, for her, did solemn glow,
The larger, as her face WIthdrewAnd could she, further, "No"?
