A Bird came down the WalkHe did not know I sawHe bit an Angleworm in halves
And ate the fellow, raw,
And then he drank a Dew
From a convement GrassAnd then hopped sidewise to the Wall
To let a Beetle pass He glanced with rapid eyes
That hurried all aroundThey looked like frightened Beads, I thoughtHe stirred his Velvet Head
LIke one in danger, Cautious,
I offered him a Crumb
And he unrolled hIS feathers
And rowed him softer homeThan Oars divide the Ocean,
Too silver for a seamOr ButterflIes, off Banks of Noon
Leap, plashless as they swim.
