I never told the bUrled gold
Upon the hill- that lies-

I saw the sun - his plunder done
Crouch low to guard his prize.
He stood as near
As stood you hereA pace had heen between Did but a snake hlsect the brake
My life had forfeit been.
That was a wondrous bootyI hope 'twas hone!>t gained.
Those were the faiJ est mgots
That ever kIssed the spade l
Whether to keep the secret Whether to revealWhether as I ponder
Kidd will sudden sailCould a shrewd advise me
We might e'en divIdeShould a shrewd betray me Atropos decide!
