Publication - is the Auction
Of the Mind of ManPoverty - be justifying
For so foul a thing
Possibly-but We-would rather
From Our Garret go
White- Unto the White CreatorThan invest- Our SnowThought belong to Him who gave itThen- to Him Who bear


Its Corporeal illustration - Sell
The Royal Air-

In the Parcel- Be the Merchant
Of the Heavenly Grace But reduce no Human Spirit
To Disgrace of Price
