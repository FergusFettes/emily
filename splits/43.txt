Could lIve - dld lIve Could dIe - did dIe Could smIle upon the whole
Through faIth m one he met not,
To mtroduce hIs soul.
Could go from scene famihar
To an untraversed spotCould contemplate the journey
WIth unpuzzled heartSuch trust had one among us,
Among us not today We who saw the launchmg
Never sailed the Bay!
