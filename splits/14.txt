One Sister have I in our house,
And one, a hedge away.
There's only one recorded,
But both belong to me.
One came the road that I came And wore my last year's gown The other, as a bird her nest,
Builded our hearts among.

She did not sing as we did It was a different tune -

Herself to her a music
As Bumble bee of June
Today is far from ChIldhoodBut up and down the hills
I held her hand the tIghter WhIch shortened all the miles And stIll her hum
The years among,
DeceIves the Butterfly,
Still In her Eye
The VIOlets lie
Mouldered this many May.

I SpIlt the dew But took the morn I chose this single star
FlOm out the wide mght's numbersSue - forevermore'
