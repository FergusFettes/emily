I suppose the time will come
Aid it in the coming
When the Bird will crowd the Tree
And the Bee be booming.
I suppose the time will come
Hinder it a little
When the Com in Silk will dress
And in Chintz the Apple
I belIeve the Day will be
When the Jay will giggle
At his new white House the Earth
That, too, halt a little
