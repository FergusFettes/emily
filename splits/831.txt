Dymgl To be afraid of thee
One must to thme Artillery
Have left exposed a FnendThan thine old Arrow IS a Shot
Delivered straighter to the Heart
The leaving Love behind.
Not for itself, the Dust is shv,
,
But, enemy, Beloved be
Thy Batteries divorce.
Fight sternly in a Dying eye
Two Armies, Love and Certamty
And Love and the Reverse.
