Besides the Autumn poets sing
A few prosaic days
A little this side of the snow
And that side of the Haze A few incisive Mornings A few Ascetic Eves Gone- Mr. Bryant's "Golden Rod"And Mr Thomson's Itsheaves"
Still, is the bustle in the BrookSealed are the spicy valvesMesmeric fingers softly touch
The Eyes of many Elves -


Perhaps a squirrel may remain My sentIments to share Grant me, Oh Lord, a sunny mmdThy wmdy will to bear!
