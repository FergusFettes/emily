A Wounded Deer - leaps highestrve heard the Hunter tell'Tis but the Ecstasy of death And then the Brake is stilH
The Smitten Rock that gushes!
The trampled Steel that springs!
A Cheek is always redder
Just where the Hectic stings!


Mirth IS the Mall of AnguIsh In whIch it Cautious Arm,
Lest anybody spy the blood
And "you're hurt" exclaim!
