Rearrange a 'Wife's" affection'
When they dislocate my Brain!
Amputate my freckled Bosom'
Make me bearded like a man!
Blush, my spirit, in thy FastnessBlush, my unacknowledged claySeven years of troth have taught thee
More than Wifehood ever may!
Love that never leaped its socketTrust entrenched in narrow painConstancy thro' fire - awardedAnguish - bare of anodynel
Burden - borne so far triumphantNone suspect me of the crown,
For I wear the "Thorns" tIll SunsetThen - my Diadem put on.
BIg my Secret but It'S handagedIt WIll never get away
TIll the Day Its Weary Keeper
Leads It through the Grave to thee.
