A still- Volcano - LifeThat flickered in the nightWhen it was dark enough to do
Without erasing sightA quiet-Earthquake StyleToo subtle to suspect
By natures this side NaplesThe North cannot detect
The Solemn- Torrid-SymbolThe lips that never lieWhose hissing Corals part - and shutAnd Cities-ooze away
