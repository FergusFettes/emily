Drowning is not so pitIful
As the attempt to rise.
Three times, 'tis saId, a sinking man
Comes up to face the skies,
And then declines forever
To that abhorred abode,
\\There hope and he part companyFor he IS grasped of God.
The Maker's cordIal visage,
However good to see,
Is shunned, we must admit it,
Like an adversity.
