I am alive - I guessThe Branches on my Hand


Are full of Morning GloryAnd at my finger's endThe Carmine - tmgles warm And if I hold a Glass
Across my Mouth - it blurs itPhysician's - proof of Breath I am alive - because
I am not in a RoomThe Parlor - Commonly -It isSo Visitors may comeAnd lean - and view It sIdewiseAnd add "How cold - it grew" And 'Was it conscious-when It stepped
In ImmortalIty'"
I am alive - because
I do not own a HouseEntitled to myself-preciseAnd fitting no one elseAnd marked my Girlhood's nameSo Visitors may know
Which Door is mine - and not mistakeAnd try another KeyHow good - to be alive!
How infinite - to be
Alive - two-fold - The Birth I hadAnd this - besides, in - Thee!
