I had a guinea golden I lost it in the sand And tho' the sum was simple
And pounds were in the land Still, had it such a value
Unto my frugal eyeThat when I could not find it I sat me down to sigh.
I had a crimson Robin Who sang full many a day
But when the woods were painted,
He, too, did Â£Iyaway -


TIme brought me other RobmsTheir ballads were the same Still, for my mlssmg Troubadour
I kept the "house at hame."
I had a star in heaven One "Pleiad" was its name And when I was not heedmg,
It wandered from the same
And tho' the skies are crowded And all the mght ashme I do not care about it Smce none of them are mme.
My StOl Yhas a moralI have a mlssmg friend "Plciad" its name, and Robm,
And gumea m the sand.
And when this mournful dItty
Accompamed with tear Shall meet the eye of traitor
In country far from here Grant that repentance solemn
May seize upon his mindAnd he no consolation
Beneath the sun may find.
