I measure every Grief I meet
With narrow, probIng, EyesI wonder if It weIghs like MIneOr has an Easier size.
I wonder if They bore it longOr did it just beginI could not tell the Date of MineIt feels so old a painI wonder if it hurts to liveAnd if They have to tryAnd whether - could They choose betweenIt would not be - to die

I note that Some - gone patIent longAt length, renew theIr smIleAn ImitatIOn of a Light
That has so little OilI wonder if when Years have pIledSome Thousands - on the HarmThat hurt them early-such a lapse
Could gIve them any BalmOr would they go on aching stIll
Through Centuries of NerveEnlIghtened to a larger PainIn Contrast with the LoveThe Grieved - are many - I am toldThere is the various CauseDeath -IS but one - and comes but onceAnd only naIls the eyes There's Grief of Want - and Grief of ColdA sort they call "Despair" There's Banishment from natIve EyesIn sight of Native AirAnd though I may not guess the kmdCorrectly - yet to me
A piercmg Comfort it affords
In passmg CalvaryTo note the fashions - of the CrossAnd how they're mostly wornStill fascinated to presume
That Some-are lIke MyOwn
