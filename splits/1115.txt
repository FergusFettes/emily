The murmuring of Bees, has ceased
But murmuring of some
Postenor, prophetic,
Has simultaneous come.
The lower metres of the Year
When Nature's laugh is done
The Revelations of the Book
Whose Genesis was June
Appropriate Creatures to her change
The Typic Mother sends
As Accent fades to mterval
With separatIng Fnends
Till what we speculate, has been
And thoughts we will not show
More mtimate with us become
Than Persons, that we know.
