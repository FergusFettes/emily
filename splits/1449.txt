I thought the Train would never comeHow slow the whistle sangI don't belIeve a peevlsh Bird
So whimpered for the SpringI taught my Heart a hundred times
Precisely what to sayProvoking Lover, when you came
Its Treatise flew away


To hide my strategy too late
To wiser be too soonFor mIseries so halcyon
The happiness atone
