A little East of Jordan,
EvangelIsts record,
A Gymnast and an Angel
Did wrestle long and hard Till morning touching mountainAnd Jacob, waxing strong,
The Angel begged permission
To Breakfast - to return Not so, said cunning Jacob!

HI will not let thee go
Except thou bless me" - Stranger!
The which acceded to Light swung the silver fleeces
"Peniel" Hills beyond,
And the bewildered Gymnast
Found he had worsted God!
