Tell as a Marksman-were forgotten
Tell- this Day endures
Ruddy as that coeval Apple
The Tradition bearsFresh as Mankind that humble story
Though a statelier Tale
Grown in the Repetition hoary
Scarcely would prevailTell had a son - The ones that knew It
Need not linger here Those who did not to Human Nature
Will subscribe a TearT ell would not bare his Head
In Presence
Of the Ducal HatThreatened for that WIth Death - by GesslerTyranny bethought
Make of his only Boy a Target
That surpasses DeathStolid to Love's supreme entreaty
Not forsook of FaithMercy of the Almighty beggingTell his Arrow sentGod it is said replies in Person
When the cry is meant1945
