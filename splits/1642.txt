"Red Sea," mdeed! Talk not to me
Of purple PharaohI have a Navy in the West
Would pierce his Columns thro' Guileless, yet of such Glory fine
That all along the Lme
Is it, or is it not, MarineIs it, or not, divineThe Eye inqUIres WIth a sigh
That Earth sh'd be so bIgWhat Exultation in the WoeWhat Wine in the fatigue!
