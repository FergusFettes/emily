What did They do since I saw Them?
Were They industrious?
So many questions to put Them
Have I the eagerness

That could I snatch Their Faces
That could Their lips reply
Not till the last was answered
Should They start for the Sky.

Not If Their Party were waltmg.
Not If to talk wIth Me
\Vere to Them now, Homesickness
After Eternrty
Not If the Just suspect me
And offer a Reward
\Vould I restore my Booty
To that Bold Person, God1945
