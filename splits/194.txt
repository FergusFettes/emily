On thIS long storm the Rainbow rose On this late Morn - the Sun The clouds - lIke lIstless Elephants Horizons - straggled down The Birds rose smiling. in their nests The gales - mdeed - were done Alas, how heedless were the eyes On whom the summer shone!
The quiet nonchalance of death No Daybreak - can bestIr The slow - Archangel's syllables
Must awaken her!
