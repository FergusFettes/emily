Dear March - Come inHow glad I amI hoped for you before-


Put down your HatYou must have walkedHow out of Breath you areDear March, how are you, and the RestDid you leave Nature wellOh March, Come right up stairs with meI have so much to telI-

I got your Letter, and the BIrdsThe Maples never knew that you were commg - tIll I called
I declare - how Red their Faces grewBut March, forgIve me-and
All those Hills you left for me to HueThere was no Purple suitableYou took it all with youWho knocks';) That April.
Lock the DoorI will not be pursuedHe stayed away a Year to call
When I am occupIedBut tnfles look so trivial
As soon as you have come
That Blame is just as dear as Praise
And Praise as mere as Blame-
