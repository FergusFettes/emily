It WIll be Summer-eventually.
Ladies - wIth parasolsSauntering Gentlemen-wIth CanesAnd little Girls-with DollsWill tmt the pallid landscapeAs 'twere a bright BouquetTho' drifted deep, in ParianThe Village lies - todayThe LIlacs - bending many a yearWill sway WIth purple loadThe Bees - will not despise the tuneTheir Forefathers - have hummedThe WIld Rose-redden in the BogThe Aster - on the HIll
Her everlasting fashion - setAnd Covenant Gentians - frillTill Summer folds her miracle-

As Women - do - their Gown

Or Priests - adjust the SymbolsWhen Sacrament - is done
