Expanse cannot be lostNot Joy, but a Decree
Is DeityHis Scene, InfinityWhose rumor's Gate was shut so tight
Before my Beam was sown,


Not even a Prognostic's push
Could make a Dent thereonThe World that thou hast opened
Shuts for thee,
But not alone,
We all have followed theeEscape more slowly
To thy Tracts of Sheen The Tent IS listemng,
But the Troops are gone!
