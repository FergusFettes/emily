If anybody's friend be dead
It's sharpest of the theme


The thinlung how they walked alIve At such and such a timeTheir costume, of a Sunday,
Some manner of the HairA prank nobody knew but them
Lost, in the SepulchreHow warm, they were, on such a day,
You almost feel the date So short way off it seemsAnd now-they're Centuries from thatHow pleased they were, at what you saidYou try to touch the smile
And dip your fingers in the frostWhen was it - Can you tellYou asked the Company to teaAcquaintance - just a fewAnd chatted close with thIS Grand Thing
That don't remember youPast Bows, and InvitationsPast Interview, and VowPast what Ourself can estimateThat - makes the Quick of Woe!
