The Love a LIfe can show Below
Is but a filament, I know,
Of that diviner thing
That faints upon the face of NoonAnd smites the Tinder in the Sun And hinders Gabriel's Wing'Tis this - in Music - hints and swaysAnd far abroad on Summer daysDistils uncertain pain 'Tis this enamors in the EastAnd tints the Transit in the West
With harrowing Iodine'Tis this - invites - appalls - endowsFlits - glimmers - proves- dissolvesReturns - suggests- convicts - enchantsThen - Rings in Paradise-
