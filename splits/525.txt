I think the Hemlock likes to stand
Upon a Marge of Snow-

It suits his own AusterityAnd satisfies an awe
That men, must slake in WildernessAnd In the Desert -cloyAn instinct for the Hoar, the BaldLapland's - nece~ity-


The Hemlock's nature thnves-on coldThe Gnash of Northern WInds
Is sweetest nutriment-to hIn1His best NorwegIan WinesTo satIn Races-he IS noughtBut ChIldren on the Don,
Beneath his Tabernacles, play,
And Dmeper Wrestlers, run.
