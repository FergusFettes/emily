Distrustful of the Gentian And jmt to turn away,
The fluttering of her fringes
CJud my perfidy Weary for my - - I will singmg go I shall not feel the sleet - then I shall not fear the snow
Flees so the phantom meadow
Before the breathless Bee So bubble brooks in deserts
On Ears that dying he Burn so the Evening Spires
To Eyes that Closing goHangs so distant Heaven To a hand below.
