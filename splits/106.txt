The Daisy follows soft the Sun And when his golden walk is done Sits shyly at his feet-

He - wakmg - finds the flowel theleWherefore - Marauder - art thou here?
Because, Sir, love IS sweet!
We are the Flower - Thou the Sun!
Forgive w" if as days decline We nearer steal to Thee!
Enamored of the parting West The peace - the flight - the Amethy:.t Night's possIbility!
