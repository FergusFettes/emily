Could I but ride indefinite
As doth the Meadow Bee
And visit only where I liked
And No one visit me
And :Birt all Day with Buttercups
And marry whom I may
And dwell a little everywhere
Or better, run away
With no P()lice to- follow
Or chase HUn if He do


TIll He should jump Peninsulas
To get away from mel said "But just to be a Bee"
Upon a Raft of Air
And row in Nowhere all Day long
And anchor "off the Bar"
What LIberty! So Captives deem
Who tIght in Dungeons are.
