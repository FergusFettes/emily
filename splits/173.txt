A fuzzy fellow, without feet,
Yet doth exceedmg run!
Of vel vet, is his Coun tenance,
And hIS Complexion, dun!
Sometime, he dwelleth in the grass l
Sometime, upon a bough,
From whIch he doth descend in plush
Upon the Passer-by!
All this in summer.
But when wmds alarm the Forest Folk,
He taketh Damask Residence And struts in sewing silk!
Then, finer than a Lady,
Emerges in the spring!
A Feather on each shoulder!
You'd scarce recogmze him!
By Men, yclept Caterpillar!
By me! But who am I,
To tell the pretty secret
Of the Butterfly!
