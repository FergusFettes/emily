Heart, not so heavy as mine
Wendmg late home As it passed my window
WhIstled itself a tune A careless snatch - a balladA ditty of the street Yet to my irritated Ear
An Anodyne so sweet It was as if a Bobolink
Sauntering this way
Carolled, and paused, and carolled Then bubbled slow away!
It was as if a chirping brook
Upon a dusty way Set bleeding feet to mmuets
Without the knowmg why!
Tomorrow, night wIll come again Perhaps, weary and sore Ah Bugle! By my window
I pray you pass once more.
