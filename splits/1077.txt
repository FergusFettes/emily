These are the Signs to Nature's InnsHer invitation broad
To Whosoever famishing
To taste her mystic Bread-


These are the rites of Nature's HouseThe HospltalIty
That opens with an equal width
To Beggar and to Bee
For Sureties of her staunch Estate
Her un decaying Cheer
The Purple in the East is set
And in the North, the Star
