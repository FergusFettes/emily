I've none to tell me to but Thee
So when Thou fallest, nobody.
It was a little tie It just held Two, nor those it held
Since Somewhere thy sweet Face has spilled
Beyond my Boundary-


If things were OpposIte - and Me
And Me it ll:ere - that ebbed from Thee
On some unanswering ShoreWould'st Thou seek so - just say
That I the Answer may pursue
Unto the lIps it eddIed throughSo - overtaking Thee
