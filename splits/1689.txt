The look of thee, what is it like
Hast thou a hand or Foot
Or Mansion of Identity
And what is thy Pursuit?
Thy fellows are they realms or Themes
Hast thou DelIght or Fear
Or Longtng - and is that for us
Or values more severe?
Let change transfuse all other Traits
Enact all other Blame
But deign this least certificateThat thou shalt be the same.
