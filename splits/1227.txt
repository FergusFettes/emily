My Tnumph lasted tIll the Drums
Had left the Dead alone
And then I dropped my VIctory
And chastened stole along
To where the finished Faces
Conclusion turned on me
And then I hated Glory
And wished myself were They.
What IS to be is best descried
When it has also beenCould Prospect taste of Retrospect
The tyranmes of Men
Were Tenderer - diviner
The Transitive toward.
A Bayonet's contrition
Is nothing to the Dead.
