'Tis good - the looking back on GnefTo re-endure a Day\Ve thought the MIghty FuneralOf All Conceived JoyTo recollect how Busy Grass
Did meddle - one by oneTill all the Grief WIth Summer - waved
And none could see the stone.
And though the Woe you have Today
Be larger - As the Sea
Exceeds its Unremembered DropThey're Water-equally
