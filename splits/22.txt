All these my banners be.
I sow my pageantry
lnMayIt rises train by tram Then sleeps in state agam My chancel- all the plam
Today.
To lose - if One can find agamTo miss - If one shall meet The Burglar cannot rob - then The Broker cannot cheat.
So build the hillocks gaIly
Thou little spade of nunc
Leaving nooks for DaIsy
And for Columbme You and I the secret
Of the Crocus know Let us chant it softly"There is no more snow'"
To him who keeps an Orchh,' heartThe swamps are pink with June.
