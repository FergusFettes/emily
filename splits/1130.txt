That odd old man is dead a yearWe mIss his stated Hat
'Twas such an evening bright and stiff
HIS faded lamp went out.
Who miss his antIquated WlckAre any hoar for him?
Waits any indurated mate
HIS wrinkled coming Home?
Oh Life, begun in fluent Blood
And consummated dull!
Achievement contemplatmg thee Feels transitive and cool.
