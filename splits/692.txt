The Sun kept setting - setting - still
No Hue of AfternoonUpon the VIllage I perceivedFrom House to House 'twas NoonThe Dusk kept dropping - dropping - stlll
No Dew upon the GrassBut only on my Forehead stoppedAnd wandered in my FaceMy Feet kept droWSing - drowsmg - still
My fingers were awakeYet why so litde sound-Myself
Unto my Seeming-make?
How well I knew the Light beforeI could see it now'Tis Dying-I am dOing-but
I'm not afraid to know-
