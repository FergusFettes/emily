What care the Dead, for ChantIcleerWhat care the Dead for Day,;)
'Tis late your Sunrise vex their faceAnd Purple RIbaldry - of Morning
Pour as blank on them
As on the TIer of Wall
The Mason builded, yesterday,
And equally as coolWhat care the Dead for Summer?
The Solstice had no Sun
Could waste the Snow before theIr GateAnd knew One Bird a TuneCould thrill their Mortised Ear
Of all the Birds that beThis One - beloved of Mankind
Henceforward cherished beWhat care the Dead for Wmter?
Themselves as easy freeze June Noon - as January NightAs soon the South - her Breeze
Of Sycamore - Or CinnamonDeposit in a Stone
And put a Stone to keep it WarmGive Spices - unto Men-
