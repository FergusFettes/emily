The Rose did caper on her cheek Her BodIce rose and fell Her pretty speech - lIke drunken men Did stagger pItiful Her fingers fumbled at her work Her needle would not go What ailed so smart a lIttle MaidIt puzzled me to knowTill OpposIte - I spied a cheek
That bore another Rose Just OpposIte - Another speech
That like the Drunkard goes A Vest that like her Bodice, danced To the immortal tuneTill those two troubled -little Clocks
Ticked softly into one.
