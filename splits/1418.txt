How lonesome the Wind must feel NightsWhen people have put out the LIghts
And everything that has an Inn
Closes the shutter and goes inHow pompous the Wind must feel Noons
Steppmg to incorporeal Tunes
Correcting errors of the sky
And clarifying scenery
How mighty the Wind must feel Moms
Encamping on a thousand dawns
Espousing each and spurnmg all
Then soaring to his Temple T all-
