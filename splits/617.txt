Don't put up my Thread and NeedleI'll begin to Sew
When the Birds begin to whistleBetter Stitches-soThese were bent - my sight got crookedWhen my mind -IS plain
I'll do seams-a Queen's endeavor
Would not blush to ownHems - too fine for Lady's tracing
To the sightless KnotT ucks- of dainty interspersionLike a dotted DotLeave my Needle in the furrowWhere I put it downI can make the zigzag stitches
Straight - when I am strongTill then - dreaming I am sewing
Fetch the seam I missedCloser - so I - at my sleepingStill surmise I stitch
