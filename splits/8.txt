There IS a WOld
Which bcar~ a sword
Can pierce an armed man It hurls ltS barbed syllables
And is mute again But where it fell
The saved will tell
On patrIOtic day,
Some epauletted Brother
Gave hIs breath away.
Wherever runs the breathless sunWherever roams the day There is its noiseless onset There is its victory!
Behold the keenest marksman!
The most accomplished shot!
Time's sublimest target
Is a soul "forgot!"
