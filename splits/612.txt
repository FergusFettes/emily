It would have starved a GnatTo live SO small as lAnd yet I was a living ChildWith Food's necessity
Upon me-like a ClawI could no more remove
Than I could coax a Leech awayOr make a Dragon - moveNor like the Gnat-had 1The privilege to fly
And seek a Dinner for myselfHow mightier He- than 1-


Nor like HImself - the Art
Upon the Window Pane
To gad my little Being outAnd not begin - again
