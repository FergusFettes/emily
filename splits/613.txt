They shut me up in ProseAs when a little Girl
They put me in the ClosetBecause they liked me "still" StIll! Could themself have peepedAnd seen my Bram - go roundThey might as wise have lodged a BIrd
For Treason - in the PoundHImself has but to will
And easy as a Star
Abolish his CaptivityAnd laugh - No more have 1
