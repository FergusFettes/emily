I'm ceded - I've stopped being TheirsThe name They dropped upon my face
With water, in the country church
Is finished usmg, now,
And They can put it with my Dolls,
My childhood, and the strmg of spools,
I've finished threading- tooBaptized, before, WIthout the chOIce,
But thIS tIme, consciously, of GraceUnto supremest nameCalled to my Full- The Crescent droppedExistence's whole Arc, filled up,
With one small Diadem.
My second Rank - too small the firstCrowned-Crowing-on my Father's breastA half unconscious QueenBut this time - Adequate - Erect,
With Will to choose, or to reject,
And I choose, just a Crown
