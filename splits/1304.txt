Not with a Club, the Heart is broken
Nor with a StoneA Whip so small you could not see it
I've known

To lash the Magic Creature
Till It fell,
Yet that Whip's Name
Too noble then to tell.
Magnammous as Bird
By Boy descriedSmglOg unto the Stone
Of whIch it diedShame need not crouch
In such an Earth as OursShame - stand erectThe U mverse is yours.
