A Wife - at Daybreak I shall beSunrISe - Hast thou a Flag for me?
At Midnight, I am but a MaId,
How short it takes to make a BrideThen - MIdmght, I have passed from thee
Unto the East, and VictoryMidnight - Good N Ight l I hear them call,
The Angels bustle In the HallSoftly my Future clImbs the Stair,
I fumble at my ChIldhood's prayer
So sOOn to be a Child no moreEternity, I'm coming-Sir,
Savior - I've seen the face - before!
