It bloomed and dropt, a Single NoonThe Flower - distinct and RedI, passing, thought another Noon
Another in its stead
Will equal glow, and thought no More
But came another Day
To find the Species disappeared The Same LocalityThe Sun in place - no other fraud
On Nature's perfect SumHad I but lingered YesterdayWas my retrieveless blameMuch Flowers of this and further Zones
Have perished in my Hands
For seeking its ResemblanceBu t unapproached it standsThe single Flower of the Earth
That I, in passing by
Unconscious was-Great Nature's Face
Passed infinite by Me
