The Angle of a LandscapeThat every tIme I wakeBetween my Curtam and the Wall
Upon an ample CrackLike a Venetian - waitingAccosts my open eyeIs just a Bough of ApplesHeld slanting, m the SkyThe Pattern of a ChimneyThe Forehead of a HillSometImes-a Vane's ForefingerBut that's - OccasionalThe Seasons - shift - my PIctureUpon my Emerald Bough,
I wake - to find no - EmeraldsThen-Diamonds-whIch the Snow
From Polar Caskets - fetched meThe ChImney - and the HillAnd just the Steeple's fingerThese - never sur at all
