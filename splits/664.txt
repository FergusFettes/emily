Of all the Souls that stand create I have elected - One When Sense from Spint - files away And Subterfuge - is done When that which is - and that whIch was Apart - mtrinsic - stand And this brief Drama in the flesh Is shifted -like a Sand When Figures show their royal Front And Mists - are carved away,
Behold the Atom - I preferred To all the lists of Clay!
