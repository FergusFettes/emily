Have you got a Brook in your lIttle heart,
Where bashful flowers blow,
And blushing birds go down to drink,
And shadows tremble so -


And nobody knows, so soll it flows,
That any brook is there,
And yet your httle draught of hfe
Is daily dlUnken there Why, look out for the httle brook m March,
When the rivers overflow,
And the snows come hurrymg from the hills,
And the bndges often go And later, in August It may be When the meadows parching he,
Beware, lest this little brook of hfe,
Some burning noon go dry!
