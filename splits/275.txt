Doubt Me! My Dim Companion!
Why, God, would be content
With but a fraction of the Life Poured thee, without a stint-


The whole of me - forever What more the Woman can,
Say qUlck, that I may dower thee
With last Delight I own'

It cannot be my Spirit For that was thIne, before -

I ceded all of Dust I knew What Opulence the more
Had I - a freckled Maiden,
Whose farthest of Degree,
Was - that she mIghtSome dIstant Heaven,
Dwell timidly, with thee'
SIft her, from Brow to Barefoot!
Strain tlll your last SurmIse Drop, like a Tapestry, away,
Before the FIre's EyesWInnow her finest fondnessBut hallow just the snow
Intact, in Everlasting flakeOh, CaVIler, for you!
e. 1861
