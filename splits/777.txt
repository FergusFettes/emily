The Loneliness One dare not soundAnd would as soon surmise
As in its Grave go plumbing
To ascertain the SIzeThe Loneliness whose worst alarm
Is lest itself should seeAnd perish from before Itself
For just a scrutmyThe Horror not to be sun1eyed But skirted in the DarkWith Consciousness suspendedAnd Being under LockI fear me this - is lonelIness The Maker of the soul
Its Caverns and its Corridors
