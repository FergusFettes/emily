'Twas the old - road - through pain That unfrequented - oneWIth many a tum-and thornThat stops - at HeavenThis - was the Town - she passedThere - where she - rested -lastThen - stepped more fastThe lIttle tracks-close prestThen - not so swiftSlow - slow - as feet did weary - growThen - stopped - no other track!
Wait! Look! Her little BookThe leaf - at love - turned backHer very HatAnd this worn shoe just fits the trackHerself - though - fled!


Another bed - a short oneWomen make-tonightIn Chambels brightToo out of sight - though For our hoarse Good NightTo touch her Head!
