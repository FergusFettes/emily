The reticent volcano keeps
HIS never slumbering plan Confided are his projects pmk
To no precarious man

If nature will not tell the tale
Jehovah told to her
Can human nature not survive
Without a hstener?
Admonished by her buckled lips
Let every babbler be
The only secret people keep
Is Immortality.
