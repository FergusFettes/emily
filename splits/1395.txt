Mter all BIrds have been investigated and laid asideNature Imparts the little Blue-Bird-assured
Her conscientious Voice will soar unmoved
Above ostensIble VIcissitude.
First at the March - competing with the WindHer panting note exalts us -like a friendLast to adhere when Summer cleaves awayElegy of Integrity.
