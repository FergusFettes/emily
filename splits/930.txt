There is a June when Corn is cut
And Roses in the SeedA Summer briefer than the first
But tenderer indeed
As should a Face supposed the Grave's
Emerge a single Noon
In the Vermilion that it wore
Affect us, and return Two Seasons, it is said, exJ.St The Summer of the Just,
And this of Ours, diversified
With Prospect, and with FrostMay not our Second with its First
So infinite compare
That We but recollect the one
Tho other to prefer?
