Not any more to be lackedNot anymore to be knownDenizen of Sigmficance
For a span so worn Even Nature herself
Has forgot it is thereSedulous of her Multitudes
Notwithstanding DespairOf the Ones that pursued it
Suing it not to go
Some have solaced the longing
To accompanySome - rescinded the WrenchOthers - Shall I say


Plated the residue of Adz
With Monotony.
