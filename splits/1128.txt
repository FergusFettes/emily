These are the Nights that Beetles loveFrom Emmence remote
Drives ponderous perpendicular
His figure intImate
The terror of the Children
The merriment of men
DeposIting hIs Thunder
He hoists abroad again A Bomb upon the Ceiling
Is an improving thmgIt keeps the nerves progressive
Conjecture flourishingToo dear the Summer evening
Without discreet alarmSupplied by Entomology
With its remaining charm
