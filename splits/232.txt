The Sun - just touched the Mornmg The Morning-Happy thmgSupposed that He had come to dwellAnd Life would all be Spring!
She felt herself supremer -

A Ratsed - Ethereal Thing!
Henceforth - for Her - What Holzday!
Meanwhile - Her wheelIng KingTraIled - slow - along the OrchardsHIs haughty - spangled HemsLeavmg a new necesstty!
The want of Diadems!
The Morning - fluttered - staggered Felt feebly - for Her Crown Her unanointed foreheadHenceforth - Her only One!
