To that Old Moses - done To let him see - the CanaanWIthout the entermgAnd tho' in soberer momentsNo Moses there can be
I'm satisfied - the Romance
In point of injurySurpasses sharper statedOf Stephen - or of PaulFor these - were only put to deathWhile God's adroiter Wlll
On Moses - seemed to fasten
With tantalizing Play
As Boy - should deal with lesser BoyTo prove ability.
The fault-was doubtless Israel'sMyself-had banned the TribesAnd ushered Grand Old Moses
In Pentateuchal Robes


Upon the Broad Possession
'Twas Irttle - But titled Him - to see Old Man on Nebo l Late as thisMy justice bleeds - for Thee!
