It feels a shame to be AhveWhen Men so brave - are deadOne envies the DlstIngUIshed DustPermitted - such a HeadThe Stone - that tells defendIng Whom
This Spartan put away
What little of Him we - possessed
In Pawn for LibertyThe price is great - Sublimely paidDo we deserve -a ThingThat lives-like Dollars- must be piled
Before we may obtain?
Are we that wait - sufficlent worthThat such Enormous Pearl
As life-dissolved be- for UsIn Battle's-horrid Bowl~
It may be - a Renown to liveI think the Man who dieThose unsustained - SaviorsPresent Divinity
