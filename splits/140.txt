An altered look about the hills A Tyrian light the village fillsA wider sunrise in the morn A deeper twilight on the lawnA print of a vermillion foot A purple finger on the slope A fuppant By upon the pane A spider at his trade again An added strut in Chanticleer A Bower expected everywhere -


An axe shrIll SIngIng In the woods Fern odors on un travelled roadsAll this and more I cannot tell A furtive look you know as weIlAnd Nicodemus' Mystery
Receives its annual reply'
