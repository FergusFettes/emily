The Bird did prance - the Bee did playThe Sun ran miles away
So blind with joy he could not choose
Between his Holiday
The morn was up- the meadows out
The Fences all but ran,
Republic of Delight, I thought
Where each is CitizenFrom Heavy laden Lands to thee
Were seas to cross to come
A Caspian were crowded Too near thou art for Fame
