A little bread - a crust - a crumb A little trust - a demijohn Can keep the soul ahve Not portly, mind' but breathing - warmConscIOus - as old Napoleon,
The night before the Crown!
A modest lot - A fame petIte A brIef Campaign of stmg and sweet
Is plenty! Is enough!
A Sailor's business is the shore!
A Soldier's - balls! Who asketh more,
Must seek the neighboring life!
