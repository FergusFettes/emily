The Day that I was crowned
Was like the other DaysUntIl the Coronation cameAnd then-'twas OtherwiseAs Carbon in the Coal
And Carbon in the Gem
Are One - and yet the former
Were dull for Diadem I rose, and all was plainBut when the Day declined
Myself and It, in Majesty
Were equally - adornedThe Grace that I - was choseToMe - surpassed the Crown
That was the Witness for the Grace'Twas even that 'twas Mine
