If I may have it, when it's dead,
I'll be contented - soIf just as soon as Breath is out
It shall belong tomeUntil they lock it in the Grave,
'Tis Bliss I cannot weigh-


For tho' they lock Thee in the Grave,
Myself-can own the keyThink of it Lover! I and Thee
Permitted - face to face to beMter a Life - a Death - We'll sayFor Death was ThatAnd this - is TheeI'll tell Thee All- how Bald it grewHow Midmght felt, at first - to meHow all the Clocks stopped In the WorldAnd Sunshine pinched me - 'Twas so coldThen how the Grief got sleepy - someAs if my Soul were deaf and dumbJust making signs - across - to TheeThat this way-thou could'st notice meI'll tell you how I tried to keep
A smile, to show you, when thIS Deep
All Waded- We look back for Play,
At those Old Times-in Calvary.
ForgIve me, If the Grave corne slowFor Coveting to look at TheeForgive me, if to stroke thy frost
Outvisions Paradise!
