I tend my flowers for theeBnght Absentee!
My Fuchsia's Coral Seams
RIp-while the Sower-dreamsGeraniums - tint - and spotLow Daisies - dotMy Cactus-splits her Beard
To show her throatCarnations - tip their spiceAnd Bees - pick upA Hyacinth - I hid

Puts out a Ruffled HeadAnd odors fall
From Basks - so smaIlYou marvel how they heldGlobe Roses - break theIr satm BakeUpon my Garden BoorYet - thou - not thereI had as lief they bore
No Crimson-moreThy Bower - be gayHer Lord - away!
It ill becometh meI'll dwell in Calyx-GrayHow modestly-alwayThy DaisyDraped for thee'
