The Heaven vests for Each
In that small DeIty
It craved the grac~ to \..;orship
Some bashful Summer's DayHalf shrinlung from the Glory
It importuned to see
TIll these faInt Tabernacles drop
In full Eternlty-

Hmv immInent the VentureAs one should sue a StarFor HIS mean sake to leave the Row
And entertaIn Despair-

A Clemency so commonWe almost cease to fearEnabling the mmutestAnd furthest - to adore-
