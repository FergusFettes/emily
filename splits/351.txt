I felt my life with both my hands
To see If it was thereI held my spirit to the Glass,
To prove it possibler-


I turned my Being round and round
And paused at every pound
To ask the Owner's nameFor doubt, that I should know the SoundI judged my features - jarred my halrI pushed my dImples by, and waited If they - twmkled backConvIctIOn might, of meI told myself, "Take Courage, FriendThat - was a former tImeBut we mIght learn to lIke the Heaven,
As well as our Old Home l "
