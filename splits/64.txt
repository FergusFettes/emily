Some Rainbow - comIng from the Fair!
Some Vision of the World CashmereI confidently see!
Or else a Peacock's purple Train
Feather by feather - on the plain
Fritters itself away!
The dreamy Butterflies bestir!
Lethargic pools resume the whir
Of last year's sundered tune!
From some old Fortress on the sun
Baronial Bees - march - one by one In murmuring platoon!


The Robins stand as thick today
As Rakes of snow stood yesterday On fence - and Roof - and Twig!
The Orchis binds her feather on
For her old lover - Don the Sun'
RevisitIng the Bog'
Without Commander! Countless' Still'
The Regiments of Wood and Hlll
In bright detachment stand'
Beholdl Whose Multitudes are these?
The children of whose turbaned seas Or what ClrcaSSlan Land?
