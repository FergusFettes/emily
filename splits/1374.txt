A Saucer holds a Cup
In sordid human Life
But in a Squirrel's estimate
A Saucer hold a Loaf.
A Table of a Tree
Demands the little Kmg
And every Breeze that run along
HIS Dining Room do swing.
His Cutlery - he keeps
Within his Russet LipsTo see it Bashing when he dines
Do Birmingh2m eclipseConvicted - could we be
Of our Minutiae
The smallest Citizen that IDes
Is heartier than we
