The SpirIt lasts - but In what modeBelow, the Body speaks,
But as the Spirit furnishesApart, it never talksThe Music in the Violin
Does not emerge alone
But Arm in Arm with Touch, yet Touch
Alone - is not a TuneThe Spirit lurks wIthin the Flesh
LIke TIdes within the Sea
That make the Water live, estranged
What would the EIther be~
Does that know - now - or does It ceaseThat which to this is done,
Resuming at a mutual date
With every future one?
Instinct pursues the Adamant,
Exacting this ReplyAdversity if it may be, or
Wild Prosperity,
The Rumor's Gate was shut so tight
Before my Mind was sown,
Not even a Prognostic's Push
Could make a Dent thereon-
