ThIS Chasm, Sweet, upon my life
I mentIOn It to you,
\Vhen Sunrise through a fissure drop
The Day must follow too.

If we demur, its gaping sides
Disclose as 'twere a Tomb
Ourself am lymg straight wherein
The Favorite of Doom.
When it has just contained a Life
Then. Darlmg, It will close
And yet so bolder every Day
So turbulent It grows
I'm tempted half to stitch it up
With a remaining Breath
I should not miss in )'leIding, though
To Him, it would be DeathAnd so I bear it bIg about
M v Burial- before
A Life quite ready to depart
Can harass me no morec 1864
