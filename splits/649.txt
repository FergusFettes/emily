Her Sweet turn to leave the Homestead
Came the Darker Way

Carriages - Be sure - and Guests - too But for Holiday
'Tis more pItiful Endeavor
Than did Loaded Sea
O'er the Curls attempt to caper
It had cast awayNever Bride had such AssemblingNever kinsmen kneeled
To salute so fair a ForeheadGarland be indeedFItter Feet-of Her before usThan whatever Brow
Art of Snow - or Trick of LIly
Possibly bestow
Of Her Father- Whoso ask HerHe shall seek as high
As the Palm - that serve the DesertTo obtain the SkyDistance - be Her only MotIon If 'tis Nay-or YesAcquiescence - or DemurralWhosoever guessHe - must pass the Crystal Angle
That obscure Her faceHe - must have achieved In person
Equal Paradise
