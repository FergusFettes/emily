I can't tell you - but you feel itNO! can you tell meSaints, with ravished slate and pencil
Solve our Apnl Day!
Sweeter than a vamshed frolic
From a vamshed green!
SWIfter than the hoofs of HOlscmen
Round a Ledge of dream!
Modest, let us walk among it
With our faces veiled As they say polite Archangels
Do in meeting God!
Not for me - to prate about it!
Not for you - to say
To some fashionable Lady
"Charming April Day"!
Rather - Heaven's Â«Peter Parley"l
By which Children slow
To sublimer Recitation
Are prepared to go!
