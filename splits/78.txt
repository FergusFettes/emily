A poor - torn heart - a tattered heart That sat it down to rest Nor noticed that the Ebbing Day
Flowed silver to the WestNor noticed Night did soft descend Nor Constellation bum Intent upon the vision
Of latitudes unknown.
The angels - happening that way
This dusty heart espied Tenderly took it up from toil
And carried it to God There - sandals for the Barefoot There - gathered from the gales Do the blue havens by the hand
Lead the wandering Sails.
