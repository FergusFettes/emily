This Consciousness that is aware
Of Neighbors and the Sun
Will be the one aware of Death
And that itself alone
Is traversing the interval
Expenence between
And most profound experunent
Appointed unto MenHow adequate unto itself
Its propertIes shall be
Itself unto itself and none
Shall make discovery.
Adventure most unto itself
The Soul condemned to beAttended by a single Hound
Its own identity.
