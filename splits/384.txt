No Rack can torture meMy Soul-at LibertyBehind this mortal Bone
There knits a bolder OneYou cannot pnck with sawNor pierce with ScirnitarTwo Bodies - therefore beBind One- The Other ayThe Eagle of his Nest
No easier divestAnd gam the Sky
Than mayest ThouExcept Thyself may be
Thine EnemyCaptivity is ConsciousnessSo's Liberty.
