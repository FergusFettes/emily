The Wmd-tappedhke a tlred ManAnd like a Host - "Come in"
I boldly answered - entered then
My Residence within
A Rapid - footless GuestTo offer whom a Chair
Were as impossible as hand
A Sofa to the AirNo Bone had He to bind HimHis Speech was like the Push
Of numerous Hummmg Birds at once
From a superior Bush His Countenance - a BulowHis Fingers, as He passed
Let go a music - as of tunes
Blown tremulous in Glass-

He visited-still HittingThen like a timid Man
Again, He tapped- 'twas HurriedlyAnd I became alone
