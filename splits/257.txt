Delight is as the flightOr In the Ratio of it,
As the Schools would say The Rainbow's wayA Skein
Flung colored, after Rain,


Would suit as bright,
Except that Hight
Were AlIment-

"If It would last"
I asked the East,
When that Bent Stnpe
Struck up my childIsh
Firmament And I, for glee,
Took Rainbows, as the common way,
And empty Skies
The Eccentricity And so wIth LivesAnd so with ButterflIes Seen magic - through the fnght
That they wIll cheat the sIght And Dower latItudes far on Some sudden morn Our portion - in the fashion Done
