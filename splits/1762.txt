Were nature mortal lady
Who had so little time
To pack her trunk and order
The great exchange of clime-


How rapid, how momentous What eXIgencies wereBut nature will be ready
And have an hour to spare.
To make some tnBe faIrer
That was too fair before Enchanting by remaInIng,
And by departure mOre.
