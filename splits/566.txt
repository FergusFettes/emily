A Dying Tiger - moaned for DrinkI hunted all the SandI caught the Dripping of a Rock
And bore it in my Hand-


HIS Mighty Balls - in death were thick But searching - I could see
A Vision on the Retma
Of Water - and of me'Twas not my blame - who sped too slow'Twas not his blame - who died
While I was reachmg him But 'twas - the fact that He was dead
