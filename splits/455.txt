Triumph - may be of several kindsThere's Triumph in the Room
When that Old Imperator-DeathBy FaIth- be overcomeThere's Triumph of the finer Mind
When Truth - affronted longAdvance unmoved - to Her SupremeHer God - Her only ThrongA Triumph - when Temptation's Bribe
Be slowly handed backOne eye upon the Heaven renouncedAnd One-upon the RackSeverer Triumph - by HImself
ExperIenced - who pass
Acquitted - from that Naked BarJehovah's Countenance
