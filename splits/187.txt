How many times these low feet staggered Only the soldered mouth can tellTry - can you stir the awful rivetTry - can you lift the hasps of steel!
Stroke the cool forehead - hot so often Lift - if you care - the listless haIr Handle the adamantine fingers
Never a thimble - more - shall wear Buzz the dull flies - on the chamber window Brave - shines the sun through the freckled pane Fearless - the cobweb swings from the ceiling Indolent Housewife - in Daisies -lain!
