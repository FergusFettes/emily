The Trees like Tassels-hit-and swungThere seemed to rise a Tune
From Miniature Creatures
Accompanying the Sun-


Far Psalteries of SummerEnamoring the Ear
They never yet did satIsfyRemotest-when most fair
The Sun shone whole at intervalsThen Half-then utter hIdAs if Himself were optional
And had Estates of Cloud
Sufficient to enfold HIm
Eternally from viewExcept it were a whim of His
To let the Orchards growA Bird sat careless on the fenceOne gossipped in the Lane
On silver matters charmed a Snake
Just Wlnding round a StoneBnght Flowers slIt a Calyx
And soared upon a Stem
Like Hindered Flags - Sweet hoistedWith Spices - in the Hem'Twas more - I cannot mentlOnHow mean - to those that seeVandyke's Delineation
Of Nature's-Summer Day!
