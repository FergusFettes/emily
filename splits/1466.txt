One of the ones that Midas touched
Who failed to touch us all
Was that confiding Prodigal
The reeling OrioleSo drunk he disavows it
With badmage divineSo dazzling we mistake him
For an alighting Mine-


A Pleader-a Dissembler-

An Epicure - a ThiefBetimes an Oratorio-

An Ecstasy in chiefThe JesUIt of Orchards
He cheats as he enchants
Of an entlre Attar
For his decampmg wantsThe splendor of a Burmah
The Meteor of Birds,
Departing like a Pageant
Of Ballads and of Bards-

I never thought that Jason sought
For any Golden Fleece
But then I am a rural man
With thoughts that make for PeaceBut If there were a Jason,
Tradition bear with me
Behold hIS lost Aggrandizement
Upon the Apple Tree
