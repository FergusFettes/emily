A Solemn thing within the Soul
To feel itself get ripe

And golden hang - while farther up The Maker's Ladders stop And m the Orchard far belowYou hear a Bemg - dropA Wonderful- to feel the Sun
StIll tOllmg at the Cheek
You thought was fimshedCool of eye, and crltical of WorkHe shifts the stem - a littleTo give yOUl Core - a lookBut solemnest - to know
Your chance in Harvest moves
A little nearer-Every Sun
The Single - to some lives.
