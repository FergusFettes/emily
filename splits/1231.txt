Somewhere upon the general Earth
Itself exist TodayThe Magic passive but extant
That consecrated me-


Indifferent Seasons doubtless play
Where I for right to beWould pay each Atom that I am
But ImmortahtyRe'ierving that but just to prove
Another Date of TheeOh God of WIdth, do not for tis
Curtail Eternity!
