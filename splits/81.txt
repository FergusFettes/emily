We should not mind so small a flower Except It qUIet bring
Our little garden that we lost
Back to the Lawn again.
So spicy her CarnatIons nodSo drunken, reel her Bees So sIlver steal a hundred flute!>
From out a hundred tree!> That whoso sees this little flower
By faith may clear behold
The BobolInks mound the throne
And Dandelions gold.
