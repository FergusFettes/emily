WhIle we were fearing it, it cameBut came with less of fear
Because that fearing it so long
Had almost made it fairThere is a FItting-a DismayA Fitting - a Despair'TIs harder knowmg It is Due
Than knowing it is Here.
The Trying on the Utmost
The Mormng it is new
Is T erribler than wearing it
A whole existence through.
