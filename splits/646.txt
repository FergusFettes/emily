I think to Live - may be a Bliss
To those who dare to tryBeyond my limit to conceiveMy lip - to testifyI think the Heart I fonner wore
Could widen - till to me
The Other, like the little Bank
Appear-unto the Seal thlDk the Days - could every one
In Ordination standAnd Majesty - be easierThan an inferior kind-


No numb alarm -lest Difference comeNo Goblin-on the BloomNo start in Apprehension's Ear,
No Bankruptcy - no DoomBut Certainties of SunMidsummer - in the MindA steadfast South - upon the SoulHer Polar time - behindThe Vision - pondered longSo plausible becomes
That I esteem the fiction - realThe Real- fictItious seemsHow bountiful the Dream What Plenty-It would beHad all my Life but been Mistake
Just rectIfied - in Thee
