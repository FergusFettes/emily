Safe in their Alabastel Chambers Untouched by Morning
And untouched by NoonSleep the meek members of the Resurrection Rafter of satin,
And Roof of stone.
Light laughs the breeze
In her Castle above them Babbles the Bee In a stolId Ear,
Pipe the Sweet BIrds in ignorant cadenceAh, what sagacIty perished here!
