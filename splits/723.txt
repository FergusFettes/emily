It tossed - and tossedA little Brig I knew - 0'ertook by BIast-


..

It spun - and spun And groped delirious, for Morn It slipped - and slIppedAs One that drunken - steptIts white foot trippedThen dropped from sightAb, Brig-Good Night
To Crew and YouThe Ocean's Heart too smooth-too BlueTo break for You-
