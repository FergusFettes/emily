I cannot dance upon my ToesNo Man instructed meBut oftentimes, among my mmd,
A Glee possesseth me,
That had I Ballet knowledgeWould put itself abroad
In Pirouette to blanch a TroupeOr lay a Prima, mad,
And though I had no Gown of GauzeNo Ringlet, to my Hair,


Nor hopped to Audiences-like Birds,
One Claw upon the Air,
Nor tossed my shape In Eider Balls,
Nor rolled on wheels of snow
TIll I was out of sight, in sound,
The House encore me so Nor any know I know the Art
I mentlOn - easy - HereNor any Placard boast meIt's full as Opera
