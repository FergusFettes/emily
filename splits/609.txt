I Years had been from Home
And now before the Door
I dared not enter, lest a Face
I never saw before
Stare stolid into mine
And ask my Business there-


"My Business but a LIfe I left
Was such remaining there?"
I leaned upon the AweI lmgered with BeforeThe Second like an Ocean rolled
And broke against my earI laughed a crumbling Laugh
That I could fear a Door
Who Consternation compassed
And never WInced before.
I fitted to the Latch
My Hand, with trembling care
Lest back the awful Door should spring
And leave me in the FloorThen moved my Fingers off
As cautiously as Glass
And held my ears, and lIke a Thief
Fled gasping from the House-
