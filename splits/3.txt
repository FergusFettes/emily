"Sic transit gloria mundi,"
tHow doth the busy bee,"
"Dum viVlmus vivamus,"
I stay mine enemy!

Oh "vem, vidi, vieW'
Oh caput capos-pie!

And oh "memento mon"
'When I am far from thee!
Hunah for Peter Parley!
Hurrah for Damel Boone'
Three cheels, SIr, for the gentleman
Who first observed the moon!
Peter, put up the sunshme;
PattI, arrange the stars,
Tell Luna, tea is waIting,
And call your brother Mars!
Put down the apple, Adam,
And come away with me,
So shalt thou have a pippin
From off my father's tree'
I clImb the "Hill of SCIence,"
I "VIew the 1an dscape 0 'er;
"
Such transcendental prospect,
Inc' er beheld before!
Unto the LegIslature
My country bids me go;
I'll take my india rubbers,
In case the wind should blow!
During my education,
It was announced to me
That gravitatlOn, stumbling,
Fell from an apple tree!
The earth upon an axis
Was once supposed to turn,
By way of a gymnastic
In honor of the sun!
It was the brave Columbus,
A sailing o'er the tide,
Who notified the nations
Of where I would reside!

Mortality is fatalGentIlity is fine,
Rascality, heroic,
Insolvency, sublime!
Our Fathers being weary,
Laid down on Bunker Hill;
And tho' full many a morning,
Yet they are sleeping stIll, The trumpet, sir, shall wake them,
In dreams I see them rise,
Each with a solemn musket
A marching to the skies!
A coward will Iemain, Sir,
Until the fight is done,
But an tm mortal hero
Will take 1115 hat, and run!
Good bye, Sh, I am going;
My country calleth me;
Allow me, Sir, at parting,
To wipe my weeping e'e.
In token of our fnendship
Accept this "Bonnie Doon,"
And when the hand that plucked it
Hath passed beyond the moon,
The memory of my ashes
Will consolation be,
Then, farewell, Tuscarora,
And farewell, Sir, to thee!
St. Valentine-'52
