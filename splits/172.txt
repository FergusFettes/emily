'Tis so much joy! 'Tis so much joy!
If I should fail, what poverty!
And yet, as poor as I,
Have ventured all upon a throw!
Have gained! Yes! Hesitated soThis side the Victory!
Life is but Life! And Death, but Death!
Bliss is, but Bliss, and Breath but Breath!
And if indeed I fail,


At least, to know the worst, IS sweet I
Defeat means nothmg but Defeat,
No drearier, can befall!
And if I gain I Oh Gun at Sea!
Oh Bells, that in the Steeples be!
At first, repeat it slow!
For Heaven IS a dIfferent thing,
Conjectured, and waked sudden inAnd might extinguish me!
