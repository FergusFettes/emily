The Robm IS a Gabriel
In humble cIrcumstancesHIS Dress denotes him socIally,
Of Transport's Workmg ClassesHe has the punctualIty
Of the New England FarmerThe same oblIque integrIty,
A Vista vastly warrnerA small but sturdy Residence,
A self denying Household,
The Guests of PerspIcacIty
Are all that cross his ThresholdAs covert as a FugItive,
Cajolmg Consternatlon
By DittIes to the Enemy
And Sylvan Punctuation
