The first Day's NIght had comeAnd grateful that a thing
So terrIble - had been enduredI told my Soul to singShe said her Strings were snaptHer Bow - to Atoms blownAnd so to mend her-gave me work
UntIl another MornAnd then - a Day as huge
As Yesterdays in pairs,
U nroIled its horror In my faceUntil it blocked my eyesMy Brain - begun to laughI mumbled -like a foolAnd tho' 'tis Years ago-that DayMy Brain keeps gIggling-still.
And Something's odd - within That person that I wasAnd this One - do not feel the sameCould it be Madness-this?
