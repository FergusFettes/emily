I dreaded that first Robin, so,
But He IS mastered, now,
I'm some accustomed to HIm grown,
He hurts a little, thoughI thought if I could only live
Till that first Shout got byNot all Pianos in the Woods
Had power to mangle meI dared not meet the Daffodils For fear their Yellow Gown
Would pierce me with a fashIOn
So foreign to my own I wished the Grass would hurrySo-when 'twas time to seeHe'd be too tall, the tallest one
Could stretch - to look at meI could not bear the Bees should come,
I wished they'd stay away
In those dim countries where they go,
What word had they, for me?
They're here, though; not a creature failedNo Blossom stayed away
In gentle deference to meThe Queen of CalvaryEach one salutes me, as he goes,
And I, my childish Plumes,

LIft, in bereaved acknowledgment
Of their unthmkmg Drums-
