I thought that nature was enough
Till Human nature came
But that the other did absorb
As Parallax a Flame-


Of Human nature Just aware
There added the Dwme
Brief struggle for capacity
The power to contain
Is always as the contents
But gIve a GIant room
And you wIll lodge a Giallt
And qot a smaller man
