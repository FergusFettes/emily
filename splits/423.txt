The Months have ends - the Years - a knotNo Power can untle
To stretch a little further
A Skein of MiseryThe Earth lays back these tlred lives
In her mysterious DrawersToo tenderly, that any doubt
An ultimate ReposeThe manner of the Chlldren Who weary of the DayThemself-the noisy Plaything
They cannot put awayC
