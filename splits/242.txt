When we stand on the tops of Things And like the Trees, look down The smoke all cleared away from It And MIrrors on the scene Just laying light - nO soul will wmk
Except it have the Haw The Sound ones, like the Hills - shall stand No Lightning, scares away The Perfect, nowhere be afraId They bear their dauntless Heads,


Where others, dare not go at Noon,
Protected by their deeds The Stars dare shme occasionally
Upon a spotted WorldAnd Suns, go surer, for their Proof,
As if an Axle, held
