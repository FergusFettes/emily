A Drunkard cannot meet a Cork
Without a ReveryAnd so encountering a Fly
This January Day
Jamaicas of Remembrance stir
That send me reeling inThe moderate drinker of Delight
Does not deserve the spnngOf juleps, part are In the Jug
And more are in the joyYour connoisseur in Liquors
Consults the Bumble Bee
