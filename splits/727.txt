Precious to Me - She still shall beThough She forget the name I bearThe fashion of the Gown I wearThe very Color of My HairSo like the Meadows - nowI dared to show a Tress of Theirs
If haply - She might not despise
A Buttercup's ArrayI know the Whole-obscures the PartThe fraction - that appeased the Heart
Till Number's EmperyRemembered- as Pte Milliner's Hower


When Summer's Everlasting DowerConfronts the dazzled Bee.
