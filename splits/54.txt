If I should die,
And you should hve And tIme should gurgle on And morn should beam And noon should burn As it has usual done If Birds should build as early
And Bees as bustling go One might depart at option
From enterprise below!
'Tis sweet to know that stocks will stand
When we with DaIsies lie That Commerce will continueAnd Trades as briskly flyIt makes the parting tranquil
And keeps the soul serene 

That gentlemen so spllghtly
Conduct the pleasmg scene!
