I cross till I am weary
A Mountam - in my mindMore Mountains-then a SeaMore Seas - And then
A Desert - findAnd My Horizon blocks

At last - the Grace 10 sightI shout unto my feetI offer them the Whole of Heaven
The instant that we meetThey stnve - and yet delayThey perish - Do we dieOr IS this Death's ExpenmentReversed - 10 VIctory?
