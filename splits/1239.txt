Risk is the HaIr that holds the Tun
Seductive in the AirThat Tun is hollow-but the TunWith Hundred Weights-to spareToo ponderous to suspect the snare
Espies that fickle chair
And seats itself to be let go
By that perfidious HairThe "foolish Tun" the Critics sayWhile that delusive Hair


PersuaSIve as Perdition,
Decoys its Traveller.
