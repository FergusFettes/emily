I should have been too glad, I see Too lifted - for the scant degree
Of Life's penurious RoundMy little Circuit would have shamed
This new Circumference - have blamed The homelier time behind.
I should have been too saved - I see Too rescued - Fear too dim to me
That I could spell the Prayer
I knew so perfect - yesterday That Scalding One - Sabachthani Recited fluent - hereEarth would have been too much - I see And Heaven - not enough for me I should have had the Joy
Without the Fear - to justify The Palm - without the Calvary So Savior - Crucify -


Defeat-whets VIctory-they sayThe Reefs-in old GethsemaneEndear the Coast - beyond!
'TIS Beggars - Banquets - can define'Tis Parching-vitalizes Wine"FaIth" bleats - to understand!
