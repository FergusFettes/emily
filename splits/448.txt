This was a Poet - It IS That
Distills amazing sense
From ordinary MeaningsAnd Attar so immense
From the familiar species
That perished by the DoorWe wonder it was not Ourselves
Arrested it - before Of Pictures, the DiscloserThe Poet - it is HeEntitles Us- by ContrastTo ceaseless PovertyOf Portion - so unconsciousThe Robbing - could not harmHimself - to Him - a FortuneExterior - to Time
