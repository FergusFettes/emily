Taken from men - thIs mornmg Carried by men todayMet by the Gods with banners Who marshalled her away One little maId - from playmatesOne little mind from schoolThere must be guests in Eden All the rooms are fullFar - as the East from EvenDIm - as the border star Courtiers quaint, in Kingdoms
Our departed are.
