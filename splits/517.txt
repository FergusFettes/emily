Of Any ButtercupAnd then He runs against

And dangles like a Mote
Suspended in the NoonUncertain - to return BelowOr settle In the MoonWhat come of HIm-at NIghtThe pnvilege to say
Be hmited by IgnoranceWhat COme of HIm - That DayThe Frost - possess the WorldIn Cabinets - be shown A Sepulchre of quaintest FlossAn Abbey - a Cocoon
