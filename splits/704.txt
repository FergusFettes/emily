No matter-now-SweetBut when I'm EarlWon't you wish you'd spoken
To that dull Girl?
Trivial a Word - justTrivial-a Smile-

But won't you wIsh you'd spaled one
When I'm Earl?
I shan't need it - thenCrests - will doEagles on my BucklesOn my Belt - tooErmine - my famIliar Gown Say - Sweet - then
Won't you wish you'd smiled - justMe upon?
