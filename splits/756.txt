One Blessing had I than the rest
So larger to my Eyes
Thad stopped gauging-satisfiedFor this enchanted size-

It was the limit of my DreamThe focus of my PrayerA perfect - paralyzing BlissContented as Despair-

I knew no more of Want - or ColdPhantasms both become
For this new Value in the SoulSupremest Earthly SumThe Heaven below the Heaven aboveObscured with ruddier BlueLife's Latitudes leant over - fullThe Judgment perished - too-


Why BlIss so scantily dlSburseWhy Paradise deferWhy Floods be served to Us- In BowlsI speculate no more-
