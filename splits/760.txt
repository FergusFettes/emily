Most she touched me by her mutenessMost she won me by the way
She presented her small figurePlea itself - for CharityWere a Crumb my whole possessionWere there famine in the landWere it my resource from starvingCould I such a plea withstandNot upon her knee to thank me
Sank this Beggar from the SkyBut the Crumb partook - departedAnd returned On HighI supposed - when sudden
Such a Praise began
'Twas as Space sat singing
To herself - and men-

'Twas the Winged BeggarAfterward I learned

To her Benefactor
Malung Gratitude
