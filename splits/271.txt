A solemn thing - it was - I said A woman - white - to be

And wear - If God should count me fit Her blameless mysteryA hallowed thmg - to drop a life
Into the purple wellToo plummetless - that It returnEternity - untIlI pondered how the blIss would look And would it feel as bIg When I could take it in my hand As hovering - seen - through fog And then - the size of this "small" life The Sages - call It small Swelled -like Horizons - in my vest And I sneered - softly - "small'"
