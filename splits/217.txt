Savior! I've no one else to tellAnd so I trouble thee.
I am the one forgot thee so Dost thou remember me?
Nor, for myself, I came so far That were the little load I brought thee the imperial Heart
I had not strength to hold 

J


The Heart I carned m my own TIll mine too heavy grewYet - strangest - heavier smce It wentIs it too large for you?
