It was not Death, for I stood up,
And all the Dead, lie down It was not Night, for all the Bells
Put out theIr Tongues, for Noon.
It was not Frost, for on my Flesh
I felt Siroccos - crawlNor Fire - for just my Marble feet
Could keep a Chancel, coolAnd yet, it tasted, like them all,
The Figures I have seen


Set orderly, for Bunal,
Reminded me, of mineAs If my life were shaven,
And fitted to a frame,
And could not breathe without a key,
And 'twas hke MIdnight, someWhen everythmg that tIcked - has stoppedAnd Space stares all aroundOr Grisly frosts - first Autumn moms,
Repeal the Beating GroundBut, most, hke Chaos-Stopless-coolWithout a Chance, or Spar Or even a Report of LandTo justify - Despair.
