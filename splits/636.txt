The Way I read a Letter's - this'Tis first - I lock the DoorAnd push it with my fingers-nextFor transport it be sureAnd then I go the furthest off
To counteract a knock-


Then draw my little Letter forth
And slowly pick the lockThen - glancing narrow, at the \VallAnd narrow at the Boor
For firm ConvictIon of a Mouse
Not exorcised beforePeruse how infinite I am
To no one that You - knowAnd sigh for lack of Heaven - but not
The Heaven God bestow
