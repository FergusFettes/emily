It don't sound so terrible-quite-as it didI run it over - "Dead", Brain, "Dead."
Put it in Latin -left of my schoolSeems it don't shriek so - under rule.
Tum it, a little - full in the face
A Trouble looks bitterestShift it - justSay 'When Tomorrow comes this wayI shall have waded down one Day."

I suppose it will mterrupt me some
TIll I get accustomed- but then the Tomb
LIke other new Things - shows largest - then And smaller, by HabitIt's shrewder then
Put the Thought m advance - a YearHow lIke "a fit" - thenMurder - wear!
