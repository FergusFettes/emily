Like Rain it sounded till It curved
And then I knew 'twas WindIt walked as wet as any Wave
But swept as dry as sandWhen it had pushed itself away
To some remotest Plain
A coming as of Hosts was heard
That was indeed the RainIt filled the Wells, it pleased the Pools
It warbled in the RoadIt pulled the spigot from the HIlls
And let the Floods abroadIt loosened acres, lIfted seas
The sItes of Centres stIrred
Then lIke Elijah rode away
Upon a Wheel of Cloud.
