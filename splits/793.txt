Grief is a MouseAnd chooses Wamscot 10 the Breast
For HIS Shy HouseAnd baffles questGrief is a Thief - quick startledPricks HIS Ear - report to hear
Of that Vast DarkThat swept His Being - backGrief is a Juggler - boldest at the PlayLest if He Hinch - the eye that way
Pounce on HIS Bruises - One - say - or ThreeGnef is a Gourmand - spare His luxuryBest Grief is Tongueless- before He'll tellBurn HIm in the Public Square HIS Ashes - will
Possibly - if they refuse - How then knO\.,.Since a Rack couldn't coax a syllable - now.
