If I'm lost - now
That I was found Shall stIll my transport be That once - on me - those Jasper Gates
Blazed open - suddenly That in my awkward - gaZIng - face The Angels - softly peered And touched me with their fleeces,
Almost as If they cared I'm banished - now - you know it How foreIgn that can beYou'll know - SIr - when the Savior's face
Turns so - away from you
