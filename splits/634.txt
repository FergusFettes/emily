You'll know Her - by Her FootThe smallest Gamboge Hand
WIth Fingers-where the Toes should beWould more affront the SandThan this Quaint Creature's BootAdjusted by a StemWIthout a Button - I could vouchUnto a Velvet LimbYou'll know Her - by Her VestTight fitting - Orange - Brown Inside a Jacket dullerShe wore when she was born Her Cap is small-and snugConstructed for the WindsShe'd pass for Barehead - short way offBut as She Closer standsSo finer 'tis than W 001You cannot feel the SeamNor is it Clasped unto of BandNor held upon-of BrimYou'll know Her - by Her VoiceAt first - a doubtful Tone

A sweet endeavor - but as March
To April-hurries onShe squanders on your Ear
Such Arguments of PearlYou beg the Robin in your Bram
To keep the other - still
