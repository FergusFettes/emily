So much of Heaven has gone from Earth
That there must be a Heaven
If only to enclose the Saints
To Affidavit given.
The Missionary to the Mole
Must prove there is a Sky
Location doubdess he would plead
But what excuse have I?
Too much of Proof affronts Belief
The Turtle will not try


Unless you leave hIm - then return
And he has hauled away.
