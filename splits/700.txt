You've seen Balloons set - Haven't You?
So stately they ascendIt is as Swans - discarded You,
For Duties Diamond-


Their LIquid Feet go softly out
Upon a Sea of B10ndeThey spurn the Air, as 'twere too mean
For Creatures so renownedTheir Ribbons just beyond the eyeThey struggle - some - for Breath And yet the Crowd applaud, be10wThey would not encore - DeathThe Gilded Creature strains - and spmsTrIps frantic in a TreeTears open her imperial VemsAnd tumbles in the SeaThe Crowd - retire with an OathThe Dust in Streets - go downAnd Clerks in Counting Rooms
Observe-" 'Twas only a Balloon"-
