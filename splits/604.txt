Unto my Books - so good to tumFar ends of tired DaysIt half endears the AbstinenceAnd Pain - is missed - in Praise

As Flavors - cheer Retarded Guests
With Banquettings to beSo Spices - stimulate the time
TIll my small LibraryIt may be Wilderness - without Far feet of failing Men But Holiday-excludes the mghtAnd it is Bells - within I thank these Kmsmen of the Shelf Their Countenances Kid
Enamor - in ProspectiveAnd satisfy - obtamed
