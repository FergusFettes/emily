Why make it doubt -It hurts it soSo sick - to guessSo strong - to knowSo brave - upon its little Bed
To tell the very last They saId
Unto Itself-and smile-And shakeFor that dear-distant-dangerous- SakeBut - the Instead - the Pinching fear
That Something - it did do - or dareOffend the VISIon-and itHeeAnd They no more remember meNor ever turn to tell me whyOh, Master, This is MIsery
