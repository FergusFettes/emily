I meant to find Her when I cameDeath - had the same designBut the Success-was HIs-it seemsAnd the Surrender - Mine-

I meant to tell Her how I longed
For just this single timeBut Death had told Her so the firstAnd she had past, with Him To wander - now- is my ReposeTo rest - To rest would be
A privilege of Hurricane
To Memory- and Me.
