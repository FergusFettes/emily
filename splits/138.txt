Pigmy seraphs - gone astray Velvet people from VevayBelles from so~e lost summer day Bees exclusive Coterie -

Pans could not lay the fold
Belted down wIth Emerald Venice could not show a cheek
Of a tint so lustrous meekNever such an Ambuscade
As of briar and leaf displayed
For my little damask maId I had lather wear her grace
Than an Eall's distmgUIshed faceI had rather dwell lIke her
Than be "Duke of Exeter" Royalty enough for me
To subdue the Bumblebee.
