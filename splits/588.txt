I cried at Pity - not at PainI heard a Woman say
"Poor Child" - and something in her voice
Convicted me - of meSo long I fainted, to myself
It seemed the common way,
And Health, and Laughter, Curious thingsTo look at, like a ToyTo sometimes hear "Rich people" buy
And see the Parcel rolledAnd carried, I supposed - to Heaven,
For children, made of Gold

But not to touch, or wish for,
Or think of, with a sighAnd so and so - had been to me,
Had God willed differently

I WIsh I knew that Woman's nameSo when she comes this way,
To hold my Me, and hold my ears
For fear I hear her say
.
s sorry I am dd"
She'"
ea - agamJust when the Grave and 1Have sobbed ourselves almost to sleep,
Our only Lullaby-
