The Truth-is stirlessOther force - may be presumed to moveThis - then - is best for confidenceWhen oldest Cedars swerveAnd Oaks untwist their fistsAnd Mountains - feeble -leanHow excellent a Body, that
Stands Wlthout a BoneHow vigorous a Force
That holds without a PropTruth stays Herself - and every man
That trusts Her - boldly up
