Tho' my destiny be Fustian Hers be damask fine Tho' she wear a silver apron I, a less divine 

Still, my little Gypsy being
I would far prefer,
StIll, my lIttle sunburnt bosom
To her Rosier,
For, when FlOSts, thelr punctual fingers
On her forehead lay,
You and I, and Dr. Holland,
Bloom Eternallyl
Roses of a steadfast summer
In a steadfast land,
Where no Autumn lifts her pencil And no Reapers standi
