As Watchers hang upon the East,
As Beggars revel at a feast
By savory Fancy spreadAs brooh In deserts babble sweet
On ear too far for the delIght,
Heaven beguiles the tired.
As that same watcher, when the East
Opens the lid of Amethyst
And lets the morning go That Beggar, when an honored Guest,
Those thirsty lips to Hagons pressed,
Heaven to us, if true.
