When I hoped, I recollect
Just the place I stoodAt a Window facing WestRoughest Air - was good-


Not a Sleet could bite meNot a frost could coolHope It was that kept me warmNot Menno shawlWhen I feared - I recollect
Just the Day it wasWorlds were lying out to SunYet how Nature froze-

Icicles upon my soul
Prickled Blue and CooIBird went praising everywhereOnly Me-was stillAnd the Day that I despairedThis - If I forget
Nature will- that It be Night
After Sun has setDarkness intersect her faceAnd putout her eyeNature heSItate - before
Memory and 1-
