A loss of something ever felt IThe first that I could recollect
Bereft I was-of what I knew not
Too young that any should suspect


A Mourner walked among the children
I notwithstanding went about
As one bemoaning a Dommion
Itself the only Prince cast outElder, Today, a session wiser
And fainter, too, as Wiseness isI find myself stIll softly searching
For my Delinquent PalacesAnd a Suspicion, lIke a Finger
Touches my Forehead now and then
That I am looking oppositely
For the sIte of the Kingdom of Heaven 1945
