Cocoon above! Cocoon below!
Stealthy Cocoon, why hide you so
VVhat all the world suspect?
An hour, and gay on every tree
Your secret, perched in ecstasy
Defies imprisonment!

An hour in Chrysalis to pass,
Then gay above receding grass
A Butterfly to gol
A moment to interrogate,
Then wiser than a "Surrogate,"
The Universe to know!
