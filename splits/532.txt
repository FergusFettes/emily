I tned to think a lonelier Thing
Than any I had seen Some Polar Expiation-An Omen in the Bone
Of Death's tremendous nearnessI probed Retrieveless things
My Duplicate-to borrowA Haggard Comfort springs
From the belief that SomewhereWithin the Clutch of ThoughtThere dwells one other Creature
Of Heavenly Love-forgotI plucked at our Partition
As One should pry the WallsBetween Himself-and Horror's TwinWithin Opposing CellsI almost strove to clasp his Hand,
Such Luxury- it grewThat as Myself-could pity HimPerhaps he-pitied me
