To hear an Onole sing
May be a common thIngOr only a dIVIne.

It is not of the BIrd
Who SIngs the same, unheard,
As unto CrowdThe Fashion of the Ear
Attireth that it hear
In Dun, or fairSo whether It be Rune,
Or whether it be none
Is ofwithm.
The "Tune is In the Tree- "
The Skeptic - showeth me"No Sir! In Thee!"
