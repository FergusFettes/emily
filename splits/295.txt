Unto hke Story - Trouble has entIced meHow KInsmen fell Brothers and Sister - who preferred the GloryAnd theIr young wIll
Bent to the Scaffold, or in Dungeons - chanted TIll God's full timeWhen they let go the Ignommy - smilmgAnd Shame went stillUnto guessed Crests, by moaning fancy, leads me,
Worn faIr
By Heads rejected - in the lower countryOf honors there Such spirit makes her perpetual mention,
That I - grown bold Step martial - at my Crucifixion As Trumpets - roIledFeet, small as mine - have malched in Revolution
FIrm to the Drum Hands - not so stout - hoisted them - in WItnessWhen Speech went numbLet me not shame their sublime deportments Dnlled brigh t Beckoning - Etruscan invItation Toward Light
