Bereaved of all, I went abroadNo less bereaved was I
Upon a New PeninsulaThe Grave preceded meObtamed my Lodgings, ere myselfAnd when I sought my BedThe Grave it was reposed upon
The Pillow for my HeadI waked to find it first awakeI rose - It followed meI tried to drop it in the CrowdTo loseitin the SeaIn Cups of artIficial Drowse
To steep its shape awayThe Grave - was finished - but the Spade
Remained In Memory-
