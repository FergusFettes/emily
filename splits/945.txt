ThIS is a Blossom of the Brain A small- italic Seed
Lodged by Design or Happening
The Spirit fructifiedShy as the Wmd of hIS Chambers
Swift as a Freshet's Tongue
So of the Flower of the Soul
Its process IS unknown.
When It is found, a few rejoice
The Wise convey it Home
Carefully cherishing the spot
If other Flower become.
When it is lost, that Day shall be
The Funeral of God,
Upon his Breast, a closing Soul
The Flower of our Lord.
