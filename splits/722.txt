Sweet Mountains - Ye tell Me no lieNever deny Me - Never flyThose same unvarying Eyes
Turn on Me - when I fail- or feign,
Or take the Royal names in vainTheir far-slow- VIolet GazeMy Strong Madonnas- Cherish stillThe Wayward Nun-beneath the HIllWhose service - is to YouHer latest WorshIp- When the Day
Fades from the Firmament awayTo lift Her Brows on You
