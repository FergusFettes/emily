The Llghtnmg playeth - all the whileBut when He smgeth - then Ourselves are conscious He eXIstAnd we approach Him - sternWith Insulators-and a GloveWhose short - sepulchral Bass
Alarms us - tho' His Yellow feet
May pass - and counterpassUpon the Ropes-above our HeadContinual-with the News-


Nor We so much as check our speech Nor stop to cross Ourselves
