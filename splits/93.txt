Went up a year this evening!
I recollect it well!
Amid no bells nor brnvocs
The bystanders will tell!
Cheerful - as to the village TranqUlI- as to repose Chastened - as to the Chapel
This humble Tourist rose!
Did not talk of returning!
Alluded to no time
When, were the gales propitious We might look for him!
Was grateful for the Roses
In life's diverse bouquetTalked softly of new species
To pick another day;
Beguiling thus the wonder
The wondrous nearer drew -

Hands bustled at the moorings The crowd respectful grew Ascended from our viSIon
To Countenances new'
A Difference - A Daisy Is all the rest I knew!
