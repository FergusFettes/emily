Promise This- When You be DyingSome shall summon MeMine belong Your latest SighingMine-to Belt Your Eye-


Not WIth Coms - though they be Minted
From an Emperor's HandBe my lips-the only Buckle
Your low Eyes-demandMine to stay - when all have wanderedTo devise once more
If the Life be too surrenderedLife of Mine - restorePoured like this - My Whole LibationJust that You should see
BlIss of Death - Life's Bliss extol thro'
ImItating You Mine - to guard Your Narrow PrecinctTo seduce the Sun
Longest on Your South, to linger,
Largest Dews of Morn
To demand, in Your low favor
Lest the Jealous Grass
Greener lean - Or fonder cluster
Round some other faceMine to supplicate MadonnaIf Madonna be
Could behold so far a CreatureChrist - OmItted - MeJust to follow Your dear featureNe'er so far behindFor My HeavenHad I not been
Most enough - denied?
