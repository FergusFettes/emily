The Soul has Bandaged momentsWhen too appalled to stirShe feels some ghastly Fright come up
And stop to look at herSalute her - with long fingersCaress her freezmg hairSlP, Goblin, from the very lips
The Lover - hovered - 0' erUnworthy, that a thought so mean
Accost a Theme - so - fairThe soul has moments of EscapeWhen bursting all the doors She dances like a Bomb, abroad,
And swings upon the Hours,
As do the Bee - delinous borneLong Dungeoned from hls RoseTouch Liberty - then know no more,
But Noon, and ParadiseThe Soul's retaken momentsWhen, Felon led along,
With shackles on the plumed feet,
And staples, in the Song,
The Horror welcomes her, again,
These, are not brayed of Tongue
