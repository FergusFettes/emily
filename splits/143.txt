For every Bird a NestWherefore in timid quest
Some little Wren goes seeking roundWherefore when boughs are free Households m every tree Pilgrim be found?
Perhaps a home too high Ah Aristocracy!
The little Wren desires Perhaps of twig so fine Of twine e'en superfine,
Her pride aspires -


The Lark IS not ashamed
To build upon the ground
Her modest house Yet who of all the throng
Dancing around the sun
Does so rejoice?
