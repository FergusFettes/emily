I cannot buy it - 'tis not soldThere is no other in the WorldMine was the only one
I was SO happy I forgot
To shut the Door And it went out
And I am all alone-

If I could find it Anywhere
I would not mind the journey there
Though it took all my store


But just to look It In the Eye"Did'st thou?" "Thou did'st not mean," to say,
Then, turn my Face away.
