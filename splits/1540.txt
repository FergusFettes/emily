As imperceptibly as Grief
The Summer lapsed awayToo Imperceptible at last
To seem hke PerfidyA Quietness distilled
As Twilight long begun,
Or Nature spending with herself
Sequestered AfternoonThe Dusk drew earlier inThe Morning foreign shoneA courteous, yet harrowing Grace,
As Guest, that would be gone

And thus, without a Wing
Or service of a Keel
Our Summer made her light escape
Into the Beautiful.
