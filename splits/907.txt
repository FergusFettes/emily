Till Death - is narrow LovingThe scantest Heart extant
Will hold you till your privilege
Of Finiteness - be spentBut He whose loss procures you
Such Destitution that
Your Life too abject for itself
Thenceforward imitateUntil- Resemblance perfect-

Yourself, for His pursuit


Delight of Nature - abdicateExhibit Love - somewhatc 1864
