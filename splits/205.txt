I should not dare to leave my friend,
Because - because if he should die
While I was gone - and I - too late Should reach the Heart that wanted me -


If I should dIsappoint the eyes
That hunted - hunted so - to see And could not bear to shut untIl
They "notIced" me - they notIced me If I should stab the patient faIth
So SUle I'd come - so sure I'd come -

It hstening - lIstenmg - went to sleep Tellmg my tardy nameMy Heart would wIsh It broke before Smce breakmg then - smce breakmg then Were useless as next morning's sun Where midmght frosts - had lam!
