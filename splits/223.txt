I Came to buy a smile - today But just a single smileThe smallest one upon your face
Will suit me just as wellThe one that no one else would miss
It shone so very smallI'm pleading at the "counter" - sir Could you afford to sell

I've Dtamonds - on my fingers You know what Diamonds are?
I've Rubles -like the Evening BloodAnd Topaz - lIke the star!
'Twould be "a Bargam" for a Jew l
Say - may I have it - Sir?
