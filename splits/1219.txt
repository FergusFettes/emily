Now I knew I lost herNot that she was goneBut Remoteness travelled
On her Face and Tongue.
Alien, though adJoInmg
As a Foreign RaceTraversed she though pausmg
Latitudeless Place.
Elements UnalteredUniverse the same
But Love's transmIgrationSomehow this had comeHenceforth to remember
Nature took the Day
I had paid so much forHIS is Penury
Not who toils for Freedom
Or for Family
But the Restitution
Of Idolatry.
