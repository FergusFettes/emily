I met a KIng this aftemoon!
He had not on a Crown Indeed,
A httle Palmleaf Hat was all,
And he was barefoot, I'm afraId!
But sure I am he ErmIne wore
Beneath his faded Jacket's blueAnd sure I am, the crest he bOl e
Within that Jacket'!. pocket too!
For 'twas too stately for an EarlA Marquis would not go !.o grand I
'Twas possibly a Czar petiteA Pope, or something of that kincI!
If I must tell you, of a HOlsc
My freckled Monarch held the rein Doubtless an estimable Beast,
But not at all disposed to run!
And such a wagon! While I live
Dare I presume to see
Another such a vehicle
As then transported me!
Two other ragged Princes
His royal state partook!
Doubtless the first excursion
These sovereigns ever took!
I question if the Royal Coach
Round which the Footmen wait

Has the sIgmficance, on high,
Of thIs Barefoot Estate!
