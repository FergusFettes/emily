There's something quieter than sleep
Within thIS inner room!
It wears a sprig upon its breast And will not tell its name.
Some touch It, and some kiss itSome chafe its idle hand -


It has a simple gravity
I do not understand!
I would not weep if I were they How rude in one to sob!
Might scare the quiet fairy
Back to her native wood!
While simple-hearted neIghbors
Chat of the "Early dead" We - prone to penphrasis,
Remark that Birds have Red!
