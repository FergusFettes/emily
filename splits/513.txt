Like Flowers, that heard the news of Dews,
But never deemed the dripping prize
Awaited their-low Brows ....


Or Bees-that thought the Summer's name
Some rumor of Delirium,
No Summer - could - for ThemOr Arctic Creatures, dimly stIrredBy Tropic Hint - some Travelled Bird
Imported to the WordOr Wmd's bright signal to the EarMaking that homely, and severe,
Contented, known, beforeThe Heaven - unexpected come,
To Lives that thought the Worshippmg
A too presumptuous Psalm
