We grow accustomed to the DarkWhen Light is put awayAs when the NeIghbor holds the Lamp
To WItness her GoodbyeA Moment- We uncertain step
For newness of the nightThen-fit our Vision to the DarkAnd meet the Road - erectAnd so of larger - DarknessesThose Evenings of the Bram When not a Moon dIsclose a sign Or Star-come out-withinThe Bravest - grope a littleAnd sometimes hIt a Tree
Directly m the ForeheadBut as they learn to see Either the Darkness altersOr something in the sight
Adjusts Itself to MidnightAnd Life steps almost straight.
