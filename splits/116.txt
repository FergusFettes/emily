I had some thmgs that I called mine And God, that he called hls,
Tlll, recently a rIval Claim
Disturbed these amities.
The property, my garden,
Which havmg sown wlth care,
He claims the pretty acre,
And sends a BallIff there.
The station of the partles
Forbids publIcity,
But Justice is sublimer
Than arms, or pedlgree.
I'll instltute an "Action" I'll vindicate the law Jove! Choose your counsel I retain "Shaw"!
