Of all the Sounds despatched abroad,
There's not a Charge to me
Like that old measure in the Boughs That phraseless MelodyThe Wind does - working like a Hand,
Whose fingers Comb the SkyThen quiver down - WIth tufts of TunePermitted Gods, and meInheritance, it is, to usBeyond the Art to EarnBeyond the trait to take away
By Robber, since the Gam
Is gotten not of fingersAnd mner than the Bone Hid golden, for the whole of Days,
And even in the Urn,
I cannot vouch the merry Dust
Do not arise and play
In some odd fashion of its own,
Some quainter Holiday,


When Wmds go round and round m BandsAnd thrum upon the door,
And BIrds take places, overhead,
To bear them Orchestra
I crave Him grace of Summer Boughs,
If such an Outcast beWho never heard that Beshless ChantRise - solemn - on the Tree,
As If some Caravan of Sound
Off Deserts, in the Sky,
Had parted Rank,
Then knit, and sweptIn Seamless CompanyC
