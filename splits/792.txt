Through the strait pass of sufferingThe Martyrs -even - trod.
TheIr feet - upon TemptationTheir faces-upon Cod-

A stately - shriven - CompanyConvulsion - playing roundHarmless- as streaks of MeteorUpon a Planet's BondTheir faith - the everlasting trothTheir Expectation - fair-


The Needle - to the North DegreeWades - so - thro' polar Air!
