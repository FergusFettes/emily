The Morning after Woe'Tis frequently the WaySurpasses all that rose beforeFor utter Jubilee-

As Nature did not careAnd piled her Blossoms onAnd further to parade a Joy
Her Victim stared uponThe Birds declaim their TunesPronouncing every word
Like Hammers - Did they know they fell
Like Litanies of Lead

On here and there - a creatureThey'd modify the Glee
To fit some Crucifixal ClefSome Key of Calvary
