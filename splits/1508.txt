You cannot make Remembrance grow
When it has lost its RootThe tightening the Sou around
And settIng it upright
Deceives perhaps the Umverse
But not retrieves the PlantReal Memory, like Cedar Feet
Is shod with AdamantNor can you cut Remembrance down
When it shall once have grownIts Iron Buds will sprout anew
However overthrown
