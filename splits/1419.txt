It was a quiet seeming DayThere was no hann in earth or skyTill with the closing sun
There strayed an accidental Red
A Strolling Hue, one would have said
To westward of the Town-


But when the Earth began to jar
And Houses vanished WIth a roar
And Human Nature hid
We comprehended by the Awe
As those that Dlssolution saw
The Poppy in the Cloud
