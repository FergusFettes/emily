I never fel t at Home - BelowAnd in the Handsome Skies
I shall not feel at Home - I knowI don't like ParadIseBecause It's Sunday-all the tlmeAnd Recess - never comesAnd Eden'll be so lonesome
Bright Wednesday Aftemoons-

If God could make a viSItOr ever took a NapSo not to see us - but they say
Himself - a Telescope
Perennial beholds usMyself would run away
From Hun - and Holy Ghost - and AllBut there's the "Judgment Day'"
