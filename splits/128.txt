Bring me the sunset in a cup,
Reckon the morning's Hagons up
And say how many Dew,
Tell me how far the mornIng leapsTell me what time the weaver sleeps
Who spun the breadths of blueI


WrIte me how many notes there be
In the new Robin's ecstasy
Among astonished boughs How many trips the Tortoise makesHow many cups the Bee partakes,
The Debauchee of Dews!
Also, who laId the Rainbow's piers,
Also, who leads the docIle spheres
By withes of supple blue';l
Whose fingers string the stalactite Who counts the wampum of the mght
To see that none IS due?
Who built this little Alban House
And shut the windows down so close
My spirIt cannot see?
Who'll let me out some gala day
With implements to flyaway,
Passmg Pomposity?
