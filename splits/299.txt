Your Riches - taught me - Poverty.
Myself - a Millionaire
In little Wealths, as GIrlS could boast
Till broad as Buenos Ayre You drifted your Dominions A Different Peru And I esteemed All Poverty
For Life's Estate with you.~
Of Mmes, I little know - myself But Just the names, of Gems The Colors of the Commonest And scarce of DIadems So much, that did I meet the Queen Her Glory I should know But this, must be a different Wealth To mISS it - beggars so I'm sure 'tIS India - all DayTo those who look on You WIthout a stmt - WIthout a blame,
Might I - but be the Jew I'm sure it is GolcondaBeyond my power to deem To have a smile for Mme - each Day,
How better, than a Gem'
At least, it solaces to know
That there exists - a Gold Altho' I prove it, just in tIme
Its distance - to behold Its far - far Treasure to surmiseAnd estimate the Pearl That slIpped my simple fingers through While just a Girl at School.
