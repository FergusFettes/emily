The Wind didn't come from the Orchard - today Further than thatNor stop to play with the Hay Nor joggle a HatHe's a transItive fellow - very Rely on that If He leave a Bur at the door
We know He has climbed a Fir But the Fir is Where - Declare Were you ever there?
If He brings Odors of Clovers And that IS His business - not Ours Then He has been with the Mowers WhettIng away the Hours
To sweet pauses of HayHis Way - of a June DayIf He fling Sand, and Pebble LIttle Boys Hats - and Stubble With an occasIonal SteepleAnd a hoarse "Get out of the way, I say,"
Who'd be the fool to stay?
Would you- SayWould you be the fool to stay?
