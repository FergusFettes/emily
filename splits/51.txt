I often passed the village
When gomg home from school And wondered what they did thereAnd why It was so stlllI did not know the year then In which my call would come Earlier, by the Dial,
Than the rest have gone
It's stiller than the sundown.
It's cooler than the dawn The Daisies dare to come here And birds can Hutter down So when you are tired Or perplexed - or cold Trust the loving promise
Underneath the mould,
Cry "it's I," IItake Dollie,"
And I will enfold!
