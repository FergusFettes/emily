My Faith IS larger than the HlilsSo when the Hills decayMy FaIth must take th~ Purple Wheel
To show the Sun the way'Tis first He steps upon the VaneAnd then - upon the HIllAnd then abroad the World He go
To do His Golden WIllAnd If His Yellow feet should missThe Bird would not ariseThe Flowers would slumber on theIr StemsNo Bells have ParadlseHow dare I, therefore, stint a faith
On which so vast depends Lest Firmament should fall for meThe Rivet in the Bands
