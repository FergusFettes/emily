A narrow Fellow in the Grass
Occasionally ridesYou may have met HIm - did you not
His notIce sudden isThe Grass divides as with a CombA spotted shaft is seenAnd then it closes at your feet
And opens further on-


He likes a Boggy Acre
A Floor too cool for Corn Yet when a Boy, and BarefootI more than once at Noon
Have passed, I thought, a Whip lash
Unbraiding in the Sun
When stooping to secure it
It wrinkled, and was goneSeveral of Nature's People
I know, and they know meI feel for them a transport
Of cordialityBut never met this Fellow
Attended, or alone
WIthout a tIghter breathmg
And Zero at the Bone
