The Day undressed - HerselfHer Garter - was of Gold

Her PettIcoat - of Purple plamHer Dimities - as old
Exactly - as the WorldAnd vet the newest StarEnrolled upon the HemIsphere
Be wrinkled - much as HerToo near to God - to prayToo near to Heaven - to fearThe Lady of the OccIdent
Retired without a careHer Candle so expire
The flickering be seen
On Ball of Mast in BosporusAnd Dome- and Window Pane1935
