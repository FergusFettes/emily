How note less Men, and Plelads, stand,
UntIl a sudden sky
Reveals the fact that One is rapt
Forever from the Eye Members of the InvisIble,
Existing, while we stare,
In Leagueless Opportunity,
O'ertakeless, as the Air Why dIdn't we detain Them~
The Heavens with a sTIule,
Sweep by our disappointed Heads
Without a syllable
