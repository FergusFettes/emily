I cautious, scanned my little lifeI winnowed what would fade
From what would last till Heads like mine
Should be a~dreaming laid.
I put the latter in a Barn The former, blew away.


I went one wmtel mormng
And 10 - my pnceless Hay
Was not upon the "Scaffold"Was not upon the "Beam"And from a thnving Farmer A Cyme, I became.
Whether a Thief did it Whether It was the wmd Whether Deity's guiltlessMy busmess IS, to find!
So I begin to ransack!
How IS It Hearts, WIth Thee?
Art thou wlthm the little Bam
Love provIded Thee?
