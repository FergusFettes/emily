In many and reportless places
We feel a Joy-


Reportless, also, but sincere as Nature
Or Deity-

It comes, without a consternationDissolves - the sameBut leaves a sumptuous Destitution Without a Name Profane it by a search - we cannot

It has no homeNor we who havmg once inhaled itThereafter roam.
