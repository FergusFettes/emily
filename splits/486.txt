I was the slIghtest in the HouseI took the smallest RoomAt nIght, my lIttle Lamp, and BookAnd one GeraniumSo stationed I could catch the Mmt
That never ceased to fallAnd just my BasketLet me think - I'm sure
That this was allI never spoke - unless addressedAnd then, 'twas brief and lowI could not bear to live - aloudThe Racket shamed me soAnd if it had not been so farAnd anyone I knew
Were going-I had often thought
How noteless - I could die
