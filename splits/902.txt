The first Day that I was a Life
I recollect it- How stillThat last Day that I was a LIfe
I recollect it - as well 'Twas stiller - though the first
Was sollTwas empty- but the first
Was fullThis - was my finallest OccasionBut then
My tenderer Experiment
Toward Men-


'Which choose I"?
That - I cannot say"Which choose Thev"?
Question Memory! '
