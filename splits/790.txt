Nature - the Gentlest Mother is,
Impatient of no ChildThe feeblest-or the waywardestHer Admonition mildIn Forest - and the HillBy T raveller- be heardRestraining Rampant SquirrelOr too impetuous BirdHow fair Her ConversationA Summer MternoonHer Household-Her AssemblyAnd when the Sun go downHer Voice among the Aisles
Incite the timid prayer
Of the minutest CricketThe most unworthy FlowerWhen all the Children sleepShe turns as long away
As will suffice to light Her lampsThen bending from the SkyWith infinite AffectionAnd infiniter Care-

Her Golden finger on Her lip \VIlls SIlence-Everywhere-
