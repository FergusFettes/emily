Wert Thou but ill- that I might show thee
How long a Day I could endure
Though thine attention stop not on me
Nor the least signal, Me assureWert Thou but Stranger in ungracious countryAnd Mme - the Door
Thou paused at, for a passing bountyNo More-


Accused - wert Thou - and Myself - T nbunalConVIcted - Sentenced - Ermme - not to Me
Half the ConditIon, thy Reverse - to followJust topartake-the infamyThe Tenant of the Narrow Cottage, wert ThouPermit to be
The Housewife in thy low attendance
Contenteth MeNo Service hast Thou, I would not achieve it To die-or hveThe first - Sweet, proved I, ere I saw theeFor Life - be Love
