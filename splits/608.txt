Afraid! Of whom am I afraid?
Not Death-for who is He?
The Porter of my Father's Lodge
As much abasheth me!
Of Life? 'Twere odd I fear [a] thing
That comprehendeth me
In one or two existencesAs Deity decreeOf Resurrection? Is the East
AfraId to trust the Mom
With her fastidious forehead';!
As soon impeach my Crown!
