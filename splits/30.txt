Adrift! A little boat adrift!
And night is coming down!
Will no one guide a little boat
Unto the nearest town?
So Sailors say - on yestelday Just as the dusk was blown
One bttle boat gave up Its sture
And gmgled down and down.
So angels say - on yesterdayJust as the dawn was red
One little boat - 0' erspent with gales Retrimmed its masts - redecked it" sails And shot - exultant on!
