I taste a liquor never brewed From Tankards scooped in Pearl .....


Not all the Vats upon the Rhine
Yield such an Alcoholl
Inebriate of Air - am I And Debauchee of Dew Reeling - thro endless summer days From inns of Molten Blue When "Landlords" turn the drunken Bee
Out of the Foxglove's doorWhen ButterflIes - renounce theIr "drams" I shall but drink the morel
TIll Seraphs swing theIr snowy HatsAnd Saints - to wmdows runTo see the little Tippler
Leaning against the - Sun
