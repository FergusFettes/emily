What shall I do when the Summer troublesWhat, when the Rose is ripeWhat when the Eggs By off in Music
From the Maple Keep?
What shall I do when the Skies a' chirrup
Drop a Tune on meWhen the Bee hangs all Noon in the Buttercup
What WIll become of me?
Oh, when the Squirrel6.1ls His Pockets
And the Berries stare
How can I bear their jocund Faces
Thou from Here, so far?

'Twouldn't afBict a RobinAll His Goods have Wings-


I - do not fly, so \vherefore
My Perennial Things?
