So bashful when I spied her!
So pretty - so ashamed!
So hidden in her leaflets
Lest anybody find So breathless till I passed her So helpless when I turned


And bore her stlUggling, blushing,
Her simple haunts beyond l
For whom I robbed the Dmgle For whom betrayed the DellMany, wIll doubtless ask me,
But I shall never tell!
