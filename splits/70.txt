"Arcturus" is his other name I'd rather call him "Star."
It's very mean of Science
To go and interfere!
I slew a worm the other day A "Savant" passing by
Murmured IIResurgam" - "Centipede"!
<lOh Lord - how frail are we"!
I pull a flower from the woods A monster with a glass
Computes the stamens in a breath And has her in a IIclass"!
Whereas I took the Butterfly
Aforetime in my hat He sits erect in "Cabinets" The Clover bells forgot.


What once was "Heaven"
Is "Zemth" now Where I plOposed to go
When TIme's brief masquerade was done
Is mapped and charted too
What If the poles should fnsk about
And stand upon theIr heads!
I hope I'm ready for "the worst" Whatever prank betides!
Perhaps the "Kingdom of Heaven's" changed I hope the "Children" there
Won't be "new fashioned" when I come And laugh at me - and stare I hope the Father In the skies
Will hft his little girlOld fashIOned - naughty - everythmg Over the stIle of "Pearl."
