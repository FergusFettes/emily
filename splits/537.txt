Me prove it now - Whoever doubt
Me stop to prove it - nowMake haste-the Scruple! Death be scant
For OpportunityThe Rtver reaches to my feetAs yet - My Heart be dryOh Lover-Life could not convmceMight Death - enable TheeThe River reaches to My BreastStill- stIll- My Hands above
Proclaim with their remaining MightDost recognize the Love?
The River reaches to my MouthRemember- when the Sea
Swept by my searching eyes - the lastThemselves were quick - Wlth Thee!
