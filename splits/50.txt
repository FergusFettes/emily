I haven't told my garden yetLest that should conquer me.

I haven't quite the strength now
To break it to the Bee-

I will not name it in the street
For shops would stare at me That one so shy - so ignorant
Should have the face to die.
The hillsides must not know itWhere I have rambled so Nor tell the loving forests
The day that I shall go -


Nor IIsp it at the tableNor heedless by the way
Hmt that within the RIddle
One will walk today-
