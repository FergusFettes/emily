The only Ghost I ever saw
Was dressed in Mechlin - soHe wore no sandal on hls foot And stepped like Rakes of snow His Gait - was soundless, like the BirdBut rapid -like the Roe His fashions, quaint, Mosaic Or haply. MistletoeHis conversation - seldom His laughter, like the BreezeThat dles away in Dimples
Among the pensive Trees Our interview - was transient Of me, himself was shy And God forbid I look behindSince that appalling Day!
