They leave us with the Infinite.
But He-Is not a manHIs fingers are the size of fistsHis fists, the size of men And whom he foundeth, with his Arm
As Himmaleh, shall standGibraltar's Everlasting Shoe
Poised lIghtly on his Hand,
So trust him, ComradeYou for you, and I, for you and me
Eternity is ample,
And quick enough, if true.
