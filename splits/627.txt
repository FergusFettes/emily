The Tint I cannot take-is bestThe Color too remote
That I could show it in Bazaar A Guinea at a sightThe fine - impalpable ArrayThat swaggers on the eye
Like Cleopatra's CompanyRepeated - in the skyThe Moments of Dominion
That happen on the Soul
And leave it with. a Discontent
Too exquisite- to teliThe eager look - on LandscapesAs if they just repressed
Some Secret- that was pushing
Like Chariots - in the VestThe Pleading of the SurnmerThat other Prank - of SnowThat Cushions Mystery with Tulle,
For fear the Squirrels - know.
Their Graspless manners - mock. usUntil the Cheated Eye
Shuts arrogantly - in the GraveAnother way:- to see
