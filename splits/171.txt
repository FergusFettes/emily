Wait tIll the Majesty of Death
Invests so mean a brow!
Almost a powdered Footman
Might dare to touch it now!
Wait till in Everlasting Robes
That Democrat is dressed,
Then prate about "Preferment" And "Station," and the rest!
Around this quiet COUI tier
Obsequlous Angels wait'
Full royal is his Retinue!
Full purple is hIS state!
A Lord, might dare to lift the Hat
To such a Modest Clay
Since that My Lord, "the Lord of Lords"
ReceIves unblushmgly'
