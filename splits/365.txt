Dare you see a Soul at the White Heat'>
Then crouch within the doorRed-Is the FIre's common tmtBut when the vivid Ore
Has vanquished Flame's conditions,
It quivers from the Forge
Without a color, but the light
Of unanointed Blaze.
Least VIllage has its Blacksmith
Whose AnVIl'S even ring
Stands symbol for the finer Forge
That soundless tugs - withinRefimng these impatient Ores
With Hammer, and with Blaze
Until the Designated Light
Repudiate the Forge
