'Twas like a Maelstrom, with a notch,
That nearer, every Day,
Kept narrowing its boiling Wheel
Until the Agony
Toyed coolly with the final inch
Of your delirious HemAnd you dropt, lost,
When somethmg brokeAnd let you from a DreamAs if a Goblin WIth a GaugeKept measuring the HoursUntil you felt your Second
Weigh, helpless, in his PawsAnd not a Sinew - stirred - could help,
And sense was setting n~mb-


When God - remembered - and the Fiend
Let go, then, OvercomeAs if your Sentence stood - pronouncedAnd you were frozen led
From Dungeon's luxury of Doubt
To Gibbets, and the DeadAnd when the FIlm had stItched your eyes
A Creature gasped "Reprieve'"
Which AnguIsh was the utterest - then To pensh, Or to live?
