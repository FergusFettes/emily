The Wind begun to knead the Grass As Women do a DoughHe Hung a Hand full at the PlamA Hand full at the SkyThe Leaves unhooked themselves from TreesAnd started all abroadThe Dust did scoop itself like HandsAnd throwaway the Road-


The \Vagons quickened on the StreetThe Thunders gossiped lowThe Lightnmg showed a Yellow HeadAnd then a livid ToeThe Birds put up the Bars to NestsThe Cattle flung to BarnsThen came one drop of Giant RamAnd then, as If the Hands
That held the Dams - had parted holdThe Waters Wrecked the SkyBut overlooked my Father's HouseJust Quartering a Tree 
Version I


The Wind begun to rock the Grass
With threatenmg Tunes and lowHe threw a Menace at the EarthA Menace at the Sky.
The Leaves unhooked themselves from TreesAnd started all abroad
The Dust did scoop itself lIke Hands
And threw away the Road.
The Wagons quickened on the Streets
The Thunder hurried slowThe Lightning showed a Yellow Beak
And then a livid Claw.
The Birds put up the Bars to NestsThe Cattle fled to BarnsThere came one drop of Giant Rain

And then as if the Hands
That held the Dams had parted hold
The Waters Wrecked the Sky.


But overlooked my Father's HouseJust quarterIng a Tree
Version II
