I had not minded - WallsWere Universe - one RockAnd far I heard his silver Call
The other side the BlockI'd tunnel- till my Groove
Pushed sudden thro' to hisThen my face take her RecompenseThe looking in his EyesBut 'tis a single HairA filament - a law A Cobweb-wove in AdamantA Battlement - of StrawA limit like the Veil
Unto the Lady's face

But every Mesh - a CltadelAnd Dragons-m the CreaseC
