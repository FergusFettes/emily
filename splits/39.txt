It did not surprise me So I said - or thought She WIll stIr her pinions
And the nest forgot,
Traverse broader forests Build in gayer boughs,
Breathe in Ear more modern
God's old fashioned vowsThis was bu t a Birdling What and if it be
One withIn my bosom
Had departed me?
This was but a story What and if Indeed
There were just such coffin
In the heart instead?
