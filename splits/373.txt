I'm saying every day
"If I should be a Queen, tomorrow" I'd do this wayAnd so I deck, a little,
If it be, I wake a Bourbon,
None on me, bend superciliousWith "This was sheBegged in the Market placeYesterday."
Court is a stately placeI've heard men saySo I loop my apron, against the Majesty
With bright Pins of ButtercupThat not too plainRank - overtake me-


And perch my Tongue
On TWIgs of singmg - rather hIgh But this, might be my brief Term
To quallfyPut from my simple speech all plam wordTake other accents, as such I heard
Though but for the Clicket - Just,
And but for the BeeNot in all the MeadowOne accost meBetter to be readyThan did next morn
Meet me in Aragon MyoId Gown-onAnd the surpnsed AIr
Rustics - wear Summoned - unexpectedlyTo Exeter
