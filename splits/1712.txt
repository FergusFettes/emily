A Pit - but Heaven over itAnd Heaven besIde, and Heaven abroad,
And yet a PitWith Heaven over It.
To stir would be to slip To look would be to drop To dream-to sap the Prop
That holds my chances up.
Ah! Pit! With Heaven over it!
The depth is all my thoughtI dare not ask my feet'Twould start us where we sit
So straight you'd scarce suspect
It was a Pit - with fathoms under itIts Circuit just the same.
Seed-summer-tombWhose Doom to whom?
