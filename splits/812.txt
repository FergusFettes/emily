A Light exists in Spring
Not present on the Year
At any other periodWhen March is scarcely here
A Color stands abroad
On Sohtary FIelds
That Science cannot overtake
But Human Nature feels.
It waits upon the Lawn,
I t shows the furthest Tree
Upon the furthest Slope you know
It almost speaks to you.
Then as Horizons step
Or Noons report away
Without the Formula of sound
It passes and we stayA quality of loss
Affecting our Content
As Trade had suddenly encroached
Upon a Sacrament.
