The Birds begun at Four o'clockTheir penod for DawnA Music numerous as spaceBut neighboring as NoonI could not count their ForceTheir Voices did expend
As Brook by Brook bestows itself
To multiply the Pond.
Their WItnesseS were notExcept occasional man In homely industry arrayedTo overtake the MornNor was it for applauseThat I could ascertainBut independent Ecstasy
Of Deity and Men-

By Six, the Flood had doneNo Tumult there had been


Of Dressmg, or Departure And yet the Band was gone The Sun engrossed the East The Dav controlled the WorldThe Ml~acle that mtroduced
Forgotten, as fulfilled.
