Make me a picture of the sun So I can hang it m my room And make belIeve I'm getting warm
When others call it "Day'"
Draw me a Robm - on a stem So I am heanng him, I'll dream,
And when the Orchards stop their tune Put my pretense - awaySay if it's really - warm at noonWhether It'S Buttercups - that "skim" Or Butterflies - that "bloom"?
Then - skip - the frost - upon the lea And skip the Russet - on the tree Let's play those - never come!
