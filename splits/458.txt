Like Eyes that looked on WastesIncredulous of Ought
But Blank-and steady WIldernessDiversified by NightJust Infimtes of NoughtAs far as it could seeSo looked the face I looked uponSo looked itself - on Me I offered it no HelpBecause the Cause was MineThe Misery a Compact
As hopeless-as diVlneNeither-would be absolvedNeIther would be a Queen
Without the Other- ThereforeWe perish - tho' We reign-
