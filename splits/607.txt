Of nearness to her sundered Things
The Soul has special timesWhen Dimness -looks the OddityDistinctness - easy - seemsThe Shapes we buried, dwell about,
Familiar, in the Rooms Untarnished by the Sepulchre.
The Mouldering Playmate comes

In just the Jacket that he woreLong buttoned in the Mold
Since we - old mornings, Children - playedDivided - by a worldThe Grave yields back her RobberIesThe Years, our pilfered ThingsBrIght Knots of ApparItions
Salute us, with their wmgs-

As we - it were - that perishedThemself - had just remamed till we rejoin themAnd 'twas they, and not ourself
That mourned.
