Through lane it lay - through bramble Through dearing and through wood BandittJ often passed us
Upon the lonely road.
The wolf came peenng curious The owl looked puzzled down The serpent's satin figure
Ghd stealthily alongThe tempests touched our garments The lightning's pomards gleamedFierce from the Crag above us
The hungry Vulture screamedThe satyr's fingers beckonedThe valley murmured IICome" These were the mates This was the road
These children fluttered home.
