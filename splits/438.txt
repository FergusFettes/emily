Forget! The lady wIth the Amulet
Forget she wore It at her Heart
Because she breathed agamst
Was Treason twixt ";l
Deny! Did Rose her BeeFor PrivIlege of Play
Or Wile of Bu tterRy
Or Opportunity - Her Lord away?
The lady with the Amulet-will fadeThe Bee - in Mausoleum laid DIscard his BrideBut longer than the little RillThat cooled the Forehead of the HillWhile Other- went the Sea to fillAnd Other-went to tum the MillI'll do thy Will
