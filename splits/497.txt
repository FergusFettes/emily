He strained my faith Did he find It supple?
Shook my strong trustDid it then - yield?
Hurled my beliefBut - did he shatter- it?
Racked - with suspenseNot a nerve failed!
Wrung me - with AnguishBut I never doubted him'Tho' for what wrong
He did never sayStabbed - while I sued
His sweet forgivenessJesus- it's your little "John"!
Don't you know - me?
