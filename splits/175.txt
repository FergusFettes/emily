I have never seen "Volcanoes"But, when Travellers tell
How those old - phlegmatIc moun tams
Usually so sollBear withm - appallmg Ordnance,
Fire, and smoke, and gun,
Taking VIllages for breakfast,
And appalling Men-

If the stIllness is Volcamc
In the human face
When upon a pam Titanic
Features keep theIr place -

If at length the smouldermg anguish
Will not overcome And the palpitating Vineyard
In the dust, be thrown ';l
If some loving Antiquary,
On Resumpoon Morn,
Will not cry with joy "Pompeii"!
To the HIlls return!
