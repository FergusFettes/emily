A Mien to move a Queen Half Child - Half Heroine An Orleans in the Eye
That puts its manner by
For humbler Company
When none are near
Even a TearIts frequent Visitor A Bonnet lIke a Duke And yet a Wren's Peruke
Were not so shy
Of Goer byAnd Hands - so slight They would elate a Sprite
With Merriment -


A VOIce that Alters - Low
And on the Ear can go
LIke Let of Snow Or shIft supreme As tone of Realm
On Subjects Diadem Too small - to fearToo distant - to endearAnd so Men Compromise And just - revere -
