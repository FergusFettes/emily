A Dew sufficed itselfAnd satisfied a Leaf

And felt "how vast a destiny" "How trivial is LIfe'"
The Sun went out to workThe Day went out to play
And not again that Dew be seen
By Physiognomy
Whether by Day Abducted
Or emptied by the Sun
Into the Sea in passing
Eternally unknown
Attested to this Day
That awful Tragedy
By Transport's instability
And Doom's celerity.
