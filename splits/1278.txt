The Mountains stood in HazeThe Valleys stopped below
And went or waited as they lIked
The River and the Sky.
At leisure was the Sun His interests of Fire
A little from remark withdrawnThe Twilight spoke the Spire,
So soft upon the Scene
The Act of evening fell
We felt how neighborly a Thing
Was the InvisIble.
