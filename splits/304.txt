The Day came slow - till Five o'clockThen sprang before the Hills
Like Hmdered Rubies - or the Light
A Sudden Musket - spIlls The Purple could not keep the East The Sunrise shook abroad
Like Breadths of Topaz - packed a Night The Lady just unrolled The Happy Winds - their TImbrels took The Birds - in docile Rows
Arranged themselves around their Prince
The Wind - is Prince of Those The Orchard sparkled like a Jew Howmighty'twas- to be


A Guest m this stupendous place The Parlor - of the Day
