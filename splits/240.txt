Ah, Moon - and Star!
You are very far But were no one
Farther than you Do you think r d stop
For a FirmamentOr a Cubit - or so?

I could borrow a Bonnet
Of the LarkAnd a ChamOIs' Silver Boot And a stirrup of an Antelope And be with you - Tomght!
But, Moon, and Star,
Though you're very far There is one - farther than you He - IS more than a firmament - from Me So I can never go!
