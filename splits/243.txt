I've known a Heaven, like a TentTo wrap its shining YardsPluck up its stakes, and dIsappear Without the sound of Boards
Or RIp of Nail - Or Carpenter But just the mIles of Stare That sIgnalize a Show's RetreatIn North Amenca No Trace - no Figment of the Thing
That dazzled, Yesterday,
No Ring - no MarvelMen, and Feats Dissolved as utterly As Bird's far NaVlgation
Discloses just a HueA plash of Oars, a Gaiety Then swallowed up, of View.
