Through those old Grounds of memory,
The sauntering alone
Is a divine intemperance
A prudent man would shun.
Of liquors that are vended
'TIS easy to beware
But statutes do not meddle
With the internal bar
Pernicious as the sunset
Permitting to pursue
But Impotent to gather,
The tranqUIl perfidy
Alloys our firmer moments
WIth that severest gold
Convement to the longmg
But otherWIse withheld.
