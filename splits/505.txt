I would not paint - a picture I'd rather be the One
Its bright Impossibility
To dwell- delicious - On And wonder how the fingers feel
Whose rare - celestial - stIr Evokes so sweet a TormentSuch sumptuous - Despair I would not talk, like Cornets I'd rather be the One
Raised softly to the Ceilings And out, and easy on Through Villages of EtherMyself endued Balloon
By but a lip of MetalThe pier to my Pontoon -


Nor would I be a PoetIt's finer - own the EarEnamored -Impotent - contentThe LIcense to revere,
A privilege so awful
What would the Dower be,
Had I the Art to stun myself
WIth Bolts of Melody!
