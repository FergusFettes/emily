One Life of so much Consequence'
Yet I - for it - would payMy Soul's entire incomeIn ceaseless - salary One Pearl- to me - so signalThat I would instant dive Although - I knew - to take ItWould cost me - just a ltfe!
The Sea is full- I know it'
That - does not blur my Gem'
It bums - distinct from all the row Intact - in Diadem!
The life is thick - I know it!
Yet - not so dense a crowd But Monarchs - are percepttble Far down the dustiest Roadl
