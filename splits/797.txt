By my Wmdow have I for Scenery
Just a Sea-with a StemIf the Bird and the Farmer - deem it a "Pine" The Opinion will serve - for them-

It has no Port, nor a "Line" - but the JaysThat split theIr route to the SkyOr a Squirrel, whose giddy Peninsula
May be easIer reached - this wayFor Inlands - the Earth is the under sideAnd the upper side -IS the Sun And its Commerce - if Commerce it haveOf Spice - I infer from the Odors bomeOf ItS Voice-to affirm-when the Wind is withinCan the Dumb - define the Divine?
The Definition of Melody - isThat Definition is noneIt-suggests to our FaithThey-suggest to our SightWhen the latter - is put away
I shall meet with Conviction I somewhere met
That ImmortalityWas the Pine at my Window a "Fellow
Of the Royal" Infinity?
Apprehensions-are God's introductionsTo be hallowed - accordinglyc, z863
