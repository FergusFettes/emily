Within my Garden, rides a Bird
Upon a Single WheelWhose spokes a dizzy Music make
As'twere a travelling MIllHe never stops, but slackens
Above the Ripest RosePartakes without alighting
And praises as he goes,
Till every spIce is tastedAnd then his Fairy Gig
Reels in remoter atmospheresAnq I rejoin my Dog.

And He and I, perplex us
If positive, 'twere we

Or bore the Garden in the Brain
This CuriosityBut He, the best Logician,
Refers my clumsy eyeTo just vibrating Blossoms!
An Exquisite Reply!
