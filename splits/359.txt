I gamed it soBy Climbmg slowBy Catching at the Twigs that grow
Between the Bliss - and meIt hung so high
As well the Sky
Attempt by StrategyI said I gained itThis - was allLook, how I clutch it
Lest it fallAnd I a Pauper goUnfitted by an instant's Grace
For the Contented - Beggar's face
I wore - an hour ago
