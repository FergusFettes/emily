I think just how my shape will rise When I shall be "forgiven"Till HaIr - and Eyes - and tImid Head Are out of sight - in Heaven I think just how my hps WIll weigh With shapeless - qUIvering - prayer That you - so late - "Consider" me The "Sparrow" of your Care I mind me that of Anguish - sent Some drifts were moved away Before my simple bosom - broke And why not this - if they?
And so I con that thing - "forgiven" Until- delirious - borne By my long bright - and longer - trust I drop my Heart - unshriven!
