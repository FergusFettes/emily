The farthest Thunder that I heard
Was nearer than the Sky
And rumbles still, though torrid Noons
Have lain theIr missiles byThe Lightning that preceded it
Struck no one but myselfBut I would not exchange the Bolt
For all the rest of Life-

But not the oblIgation

And every clamor bright
Is but the gleam concomItant
Of that waylaymg LIghtThe Thought is quiet as a FlakeA Crash WIthout a Sound,
How LIfe's reverbetatlon
Its Explanation found
