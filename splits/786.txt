Severer SerVIce of myself
I - hastened to demand
To fill the awful Vacuum
Your lIfe had left behindI worried Nature with my \Vheels
When Hers had ceased to run When she had put away Her Work
My own had just begun.
I strove to weary Brain and BoneTo harass to fatIgue
The glittering Retinue of nervesVitality to clog
To some dull comfort Those obtain
Who put a Head away
They knew the HaIr toAnd forget the color of the DayAffuction would not be appeasedThe Darkness braced as firm
As all my stratagem had been
The MIdnight to confirm No Drug for Consciousness - can beAlternative to die
Is Nature's only Pharmacy
