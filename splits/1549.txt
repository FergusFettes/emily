My Wars are laid away in Booksr have one Battle moreA Foe whom I have never seen
But oft has scanned me o'erAnd hesitated me between
And others at my side,
But chose the best- Neglecting me- till
All the rest, have diedHow sweet if r am not forgot
By Chums that passed awaySmce Playmates at threescore and ten
Are such a scarcity
