The Symptom of the GaleThe Second of DismayBetween its Rumor and its FaceIs ahnost Revelry

The Houses firmer rootThe Heavens cannot be foundThe Upper Surfaces of things
Take covert in the GroundThe Mem'ry of the Sun
Not Any can recallAlthough by Nature's sterling Watch
So scant an intervalAnd when the Noise is caught
And Nature looks around"We dreamed it") She mterrogates"Good Morning" - We propound?
