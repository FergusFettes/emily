Joy to have merited the PainTo merit the ReleaseJoy to have penshed every stepTo Compass ParadisePardon - to look upon thy faceWIth these old fashioned EyesBetter than new - could be - for thatThough bought in Paradise Because they looked on thee beforeAnd thou hast looked on themProve Me-My Hazel Witnesses
The features are the same-

So Beet thou wert, when presentSo mfinite - when goneAn Orient's ApparitionRemanded of the MornThe Height I recollect'Twas even with the HillsThe Depth upon my Soul was notchedAs Floods-on Whites of WheelsTo Haunt - till Time have dropped
His last Decade away,
And Haunting actualize - to last
At least-Etemity
