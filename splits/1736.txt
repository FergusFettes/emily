Proud of my broken heart, smce thou didst break it,
Proud of the pain I dId not feel till thee,
Proud of my night, since thou Wlth moons dost slake it,

Not to partake thy passion, my humllity.
Thou can'st not boast, like Jesus, drunken Wlthout compamon
Was the strong cup of anguish brewed for the Nazarene
Thou can'st not pierce tradition with the peerless puncture,
See! I usurped thy crucifix to honor mme!
