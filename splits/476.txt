I meant to have but modest needsSuch as Content - and HeavenWIthin my income - these could he
And Life and I - keep evenBut smce the last - mcluded bothIt would suffice my Prayer
But just for One - to stipulateAnd Grace would grant the PairAnd so - upon this wise - I prayedGreat Spirit - Give to me
A Heaven not so large as Yours,
But large enough - for meA Smile suffused Jehovah's faceThe Cherubim - withdrewGrave Saints stole out to look at meAnd showed their dimples - tooI left the Place, with all my mightI threw my Prayer awayThe Quiet Ages picked it upAnd Judgment - twinkled - tooThat one so honest - be extantIt take the Tale for true-


That "Whatsoever Ye shall askItself be given You"But I, grown shrewder - scan the Skies
With a SUSpiclOUS AirAs Children - swindled for the first
All Swmdlers - be - infer
