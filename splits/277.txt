What If I say I shall not wait!
What if I burst the Beshly Gate And pass escaped - to thee l
What If I file this Mortal- offSee where It hurt me - That's enough And wade in Liberty!
They cannot take me - any more'
Dungeons can call- and Guns Implore
Unmeamng - now - to me -

As laughter - was - an hour ago Or Laces - or a Travelling ShowOr who died - yesterday!
