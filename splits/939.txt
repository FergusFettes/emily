What I see not, I better seeThrough Faith - my Hazel Eye
Has periods of shuttingBut, No lid has MemoryFor frequent, all my sense obscured
I equally behold
As someone held a light unto
The Features so belovedAnd I arise - and in my DreamDo Thee distinguished Grace Till jealous Daylight interruptAnd mar thy perfectness
