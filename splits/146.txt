On such a night, or such a night,
Would anybody care
If such a little figure
Slipped quiet from its chair So qUIet - Oh how qUIet,
That nobody might know
But that the little figure
Rocked softer - to and fro On such a dawn, or such a dawn Would anybody sigh
That such a little figule
Too sound asleep did lie
For Chanticleer to wake it Or stirring house below Or giddy bird in orchard Or early task to do?
There was a little figure plump
For every little knoll Busy needles, and spools of thread And trudging feet from schoolPlaymates, and holidays, and nuts And visions vast and smallStrange that the feet so precious charged
Should reach SO small a goal!
