There is a morn by men unseen Whose maids upon remoter green
Keep their Seraphic MayAnd all day long, with dance and game,
And gambol I may never name Employ their holiday.
Here to light measure, move the feet
Which walk no more the village street Nor by the wood are found-


Hele are the blrds that sought the sun
When last year's distaff idle hung
And summer's brows were bound.
Ne'er saw I such a wondrous sceneNe'er such a rmg on such a glCenNor so serene array As if the stars some summer Olght
Should swing thelr cups of ChI ysolite And revel till the day -

Like thee to dance -like thee to sing People upon the mystic green I ask, each new May Morn
I wait thy far, fantastic bellsAnnouncing me in other dells Unto the different dawn!
