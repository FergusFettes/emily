Is Bliss then, such Abyss,
I must not put my foot amiss
For fear I spoil my shoe?
I'd rather suit my foot
Than save my BootFor yet to buy another Pair
Is possible,
At any storeBut Bliss, is sold just once.
The Patent lost
None buy it any moreSay, Foot, decide the pointThe Lady cross, or not?
Verdict for Boot!
