The Skies can't keep their secret!
They tell it to the HillsThe Hills Just tell the Orchards And they - the Daffodils!
A Bird - by chance - that goes that way Soft overhears the whole If I should bribe the lIttle BIrdWho knows but she would tell?
I think I won't - however It's finer - not to knowIf Summer wele an Axiom What sorcery had Snow?
So keep your secret - Father'
I would not - If I could,
Know what the Sapplme Fellows, do,
In your new-fashIOned world!
