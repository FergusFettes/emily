The Beggar Lad - dies earlyIt's Somewhat in the ColdAnd Somewhat in the Trudging feetAnd haply, in the WorldThe Cruel- smiling - bowing WorldThat took its Cambric WayNor heard the timid cry for "Bread" "Sweet Lady - Charity" Among Redeemed Children
IT Trudging feet may standThe Barefoot time forgotten - soThe Sleet - the bitter WindThe Childish Hands that teased for Pence
Lifted adOring - thenTo Him whom never Ragged-Coat
Did supplicate in vain1945
