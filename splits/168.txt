If the foolish, call them "flowers" Need the wiser, tell?
If the Savants "Classify" them
It is just as well!
Those who read the "Revelations"
Must not criticize
Those who read the same Edition With beclouded Eyes!
Could we stand with that Old "Moses" uCanaan" denied 

Scan like him, the stately landscape
On the other sIde Doubtless, we should deem superfluous
Many Sciences,
Not pursued by learned Angels
In scholastIc skIes!
Low amid that glad Belles lettres
Grant that we may stand,
Stars, amid profound Galaxtes At that grand "RIght hand"!
