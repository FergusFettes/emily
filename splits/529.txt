I'm sorry for the Dead - TodayIt's such congenial times
Old Neighbors have at fencesIt's time d year for Hay.
And Broad - Sunburned Acquaintance
Discourse between the ToilAnd laugh, a homely species
That makes the Fences smile-

It seems so straight to lie away
From all the noise of Fields-


The Busy Carts - the fragran t Cocks The Mower's Metre- Steals
A Trouble lest they're homesIckThose Farmers - and their Wives Set separate from the FarmingAnd all the Neighbors' livesA Wonder if the Sepulchre
Don't feel a lonesome wayWhen Men - and Boys - and Carts - and June,
Go down the FIelds to "Hay"
