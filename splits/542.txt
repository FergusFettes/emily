I had no Cause to be awakeMy Best-was gone to sleepAnd Morn a new politeness tookAnd failed to wake them upBut called the others-clearAnd passed their Curtains bySweet Morning - When I oversleepKnock - Recollect - to Me-

I looked at Sunrise-OnceAnd then I looked at ThemAnd wishfulness in me aroseFor Circumstance the same'Twas such an Ample PeaceIt could not hold a Sigh'Twas Sabbath-with the Bells divorced'Twas Sunset - all the Day-


So choosing but a Gown And taking but a PrayerThe only Raiment I should needI struggled - and was There
