I like to see it lap the MilesAnd lick the Valleys upAnd stop to feed itself at TanksAnd then - prodigIOus step
Around a Pile of MountainsAnd supercilious peer
In Shanties - by the sides of RoadsAnd then a Quarry pare
To Â£t its Ribs
And crawl between
Complaining all the while
In horrid - hooting stanzaThen chase itself down HillAnd neigh like BoanergesThen-punctual as a Star
Stop-docile and omnipotent
At its own stable door
