Some keep the Sabbath gomg to Church-

I keep it, staying at HomeWith a Bobolink for a ChoristerAnd an Orchard, for a DomeSome keep the Sabbath in SurpliceI just wear my WingsAnd instead of tolling the Bell, for Church,
Our little Sexton - sings.
God preaches, a noted Clergyman And the sermon is never long,


So mstead of gettmg to Heaven, at lastI'm going, all along.
