My PortIon IS Defeat - todayA paler luck than VlctoryLess Paeans - fewer BellsThe Drums don't follow Me - with tunesDefeat - a somewhat slower - meansMore Arduous than Balls'Tis populous with Bone and stain And Men too straight to stoop again,
And Piles of solid MoanAnd Chips of Blank - in BoYIsh EyesAnd scraps of PrayerAnd Death's surprISe,
Stamped visible - in StoneThere's somewhat prouder, over thereThe Trumpets tell it to the AirHow different Victory
To Him who has it- and the One
Who to have had it, would have been
Contenteder - to die
