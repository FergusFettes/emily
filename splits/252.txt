I can wade Grief Whole Pools of it I'm used to that But the least push of Joy
Breaks up my feet And I tip - drunken Let no Pebble - smile 'Twas the New LiquorThat was all'
Power is only Pain Stranded, thro' Disciplme,
Till Weights - will hang Give Balm - to Giants And they'll wIlt, lIke Men Give Himmaleh They'll Carry - Him!
