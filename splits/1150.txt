How many schemes may die
In one short Afternoon
Entirely unknown
To those they most concernThe man that was not lost
Because by accident
He varIed by a Ribbon's width
From his accustomed routeThe Love that would not try
Because beSIde the Door
It must be competItions
Some unsuspecting Horse was tied
Surveying his Despair
