The feet of people walking home
With gayer sandals go The Crocus - till she rh,es
The Vassal of the snowThe lips at Hallelujah
Long years of practIse bore
Till bye and bye these Bargemen
Walked singing on the shore.
Pearls are the Diver's farthings
Extorted from the Sea Pinions - the Seraph's wagon
Pedestrian once - as we -


NIght IS the mormng's Canvas
Larceny - legacy Death, but our rapt attention
To Immortahty.
My figures fall to tell me
How far the VIllage lIesWho~e peasants are the AngelsWhose Cantons dot the skies My ClassIcs veIl theIr faces My faIth that Dark adores Which from its solemn abbeys
Such resurrection pours.
