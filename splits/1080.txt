When they come back - if Blossoms doI always feel a doubt


If Blossoms can be born again
When once the Art is outWhen they begin, If Robins may,
I alwavs had a fear
I dId ~ot tell, it was their last Expenment
Last Year,
When It is May, if May return,
Had nobody a pang
Lest In a Face so beautIful
He mIght not look again?

If I am there - One does not know
What Party-One may be
Tomorrow, but If I am there
I take back all I sayC
