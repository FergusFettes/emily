Under the Light, yet under,
Under the Grass and the Dirt,
Under the Beetle's Cellar
Under the Clover's Root,

Further than Ann could stretch
Were it Giant long,
Further than Sunshine could
Were the Day Year long,
Over the Light, yet over,
Over the Arc of the BirdOver the Comet's chimneyOver the CubIt's Head,
Further than Guess can gallop
Further than Riddle ride Oh for a DIsc to the Distance
Between Ourselves and the Dead!
