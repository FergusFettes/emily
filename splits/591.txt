To interrupt His Yellow Plan
The Sun does not allow
Caprices of the AtmosphereAnd even when the Snow
Heaves Balls of Specks, like Vicious Boy
Directly in His EyeDoes not so much as tum His Head
Busy with Majesty'Tis His to stimulate the EarthAnd magnetize the Sea

And bind Astronomy, in place,
Yet Any passing by
Would deem Ourselves - the busier
As the Minutest Bee
That rides - emIts a ThunderA Bomb - to justify
