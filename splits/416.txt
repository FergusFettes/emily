A Murmur In the Trees - to noteNot loud enough - for WindA Star - not far enough to seekNor near enough - to nndA long -long Yellow - on the LawnA Hubbub - as of feetNot audible - as Ours - to UsBut dapperer-More SweetA Hurrying Home of little Men
To Houses unperceived-


All thIs - and more -If I should tellWould never be believedOf RobIns in the Trundle bed
How many I espy
Whose NIghtgowns could not hide the WmgsAlthough I heard them tryBut then I promised ne'er to tellHow could I break My Word'
So go your Way - and I'll go MIneNo fear you'll miss the Road
