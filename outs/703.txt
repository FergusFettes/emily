Out of sight? What of that?
See the Bird - reach it!
Curve by Curve - Sweep by Sweep -
Round the Steep Air -

Danger! What IS that to Her?
Better 'tis to fall - there -
Than debate - here -

Blue IS Blue - the World through -
Amber - Amber - Dew - Dew -

Seek - Friend - and see -
Heaven IS shy of Earth - that's all -
Bashful Heaven - thy Lover's small -
Hide - too - from thee -
