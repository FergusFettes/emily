Morning
means - Milk -
To the Farmer -
Dawn - to the Teneriffe - 

Dice - to the Maid -
Morning means just - Risk -
To the Lover -
Just revelation - to the Beloved -

Epicures - date a Breakfast - by it -
Brides - an Apocalypse -
Worlds - a Flood -

Faint-going Lives -
Their Lapse from Sighing -
Faith - The Experiment -
Of Our Lord -
