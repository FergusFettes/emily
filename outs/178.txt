I cautious, scanned my little life—
I winnowed what would fade
From what would last till Heads like mine
Should be a-dreaming laid.

I put the latter in a Barn—
The former, blew away.
I went one winter morning
And lo—my priceless Hay

Was not upon the "Scaffold"—
Was not upon the "Beam"—
And from a thriving Farmer—
A Bankrupt, I became.

Whether a Thief did it—
Whether It was the wind—
Whether Deity's guiltless—
My business is, to find!

So I begin to ransack!—
How is It—Hearts, with Thee?
Art thou within the little Barn
Love provided Thee?
