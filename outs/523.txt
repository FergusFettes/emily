Sweet - You forgot - but I remembered
Every time - for Two -
So that the Sum be never hindered
Through Decay of You -

Say if I erred? Accuse my Fath'lings -
Blame the little Hand
Happy - It be for You - a Beggar's -
Seeking More - to spend -

Just to be Rich - to waste my Guineas
On so Best a Heart -
Just to be Poor - for Barefoot Vision
You - Sweet - Shut me out -
