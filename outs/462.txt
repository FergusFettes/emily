Why make it doubt - it hurts it so -
So sick - to guess -
So strong - to know -
So brave - upon its little bed

To tell the very last they said
Unto itself - and smile - and shake
For that dear - distant - dangerous - sake -

But - the instead - the pinching fear
That something - it did do - or dare -
Offend the vision - and it be
And they no more remember me -

Nor ever turn to tell me why -
Oh, Master, this is misery -
