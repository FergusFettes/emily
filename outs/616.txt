I rose - because He sank -  
I thought it would be opposite -  
But when his power dropped -  
My Soul grew straight.

I cheered my fainting Prince -  
I sang firm - even - Chants -  
I helped his Film - with Hymn -  
And when the Dews drew off -  

That held his Forehead stiff -  
I met him - Balm to Balm -  
I told him Best - must pass -  
Through this low Arch of Flesh -

No Casque so brave -  
It spurn the Gravel - told him Worlds I knew -  
Where Emperors grew -  
Who recollected us -

If we were true -  
And so - With Thews of Hymn -  
And Smew from within -  
And ways I knew not that I knew - till then -  
I lifted Him -
