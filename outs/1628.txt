A Drunkard cannot meet a Cork  
Without a Revery—  
And so encountering a Fly  
This January Day—  

Jamaicas of Remembrance stir  
That send me reeling in—  
The moderate drinker of Delight  
Does not deserve the spring—

Of juleps part are In the Jug  
And more are in the joy—  
Your connoisseur in Liquors  
Consults the Bumble Bee—
