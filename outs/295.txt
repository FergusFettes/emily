Unto like Story – Trouble has enticed me –  
How Kinsmen fell –  
Brothers and Sisters – who preferred the Glory –  
And their young will –  

Bent to the Scaffold, or in Dungeons – chanted –  
Till God's full time –  
When they let go the Ignominy – smiling –  
And Shame went still –  

Unto guessed Crests, by moaning fancy, leads me –  
Worn fair –  
By Heads rejected – in the lower country –  
Of honors there –  

Such spirit makes her perpetual mention,  
That I – grown bold –  
Step martial – at my Crucifixion –  
As Trumpets – rolled –  

Feet, small as mine – have marched in Revolution –  
Firm to the Drum –  
Hands – not so stout – hoisted them – in Witness –  
When Speech went numb –  

Let me not shame their sublime deportments –  
Drilled bright –  
Beckoning – Etruscan invitation –  
Toward Light –
