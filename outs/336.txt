The face I carry with me - last  
When I go out of Time -  
To take my Rank - by - in the West -  
That face - will just be thine -  

I'll hand It to the Angel -  
That - Sir - was my Degree -  
In Kingdoms - you have heard the RaIsed -  
Refer to - poSSibly -

He'll take it - scan It - step aside -  
Return - with such a crown -  
As Gabriel - never capered at -  
And beg me put it on -  

And then - he'll turn me round and round -  
To an admiring sky -  
As one that bore her Master's name -  
SuffiCIent Royalty!
