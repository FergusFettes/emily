Ah, Teneriffe!  
Retreating Mountain!  
Purples of Ages - pause for you -  
Sunset-reviews her Sapphire Regiment -  
Day - drops you her Red Adieu!  

Still - Clad in your Mail of Ices -  
Thigh of Granite - and thew - of Steel -  
Heedless - alike - of pomp - or parting -  
Ah, Teneriffe!  
I'm kneeling - still -
