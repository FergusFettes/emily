To learn the Transport by the Pain—  
As Blind Men learn the sun!  
To die of thirst—suspecting  
That Brooks in Meadows run!

To stay the homesick—homesick feet  
Upon a foreign shore—  
Haunted by native lands, the while—  
And blue—beloved Air!

This is the Sovereign Anguish!  
This—the Signal Woe!  
These are the patient "Laureates"  
Whose Voices—trained—below—

Ascend in ceaseless Carol—  
Inaudible, indeed,  
To us—the duller scholars  
Of the Mysterious Bard!
