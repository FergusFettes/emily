The Future—never spoke—   
Nor will He—like the Dumb—   
Reveal by Sign—a syllable   
Of His Profound To Come—   

But when the News be ripe—   
Presents It—in the Act—   
Forestalling Preparation—   
Escape—or Substitute—   

Indifferent to Him—   
The Dower—as the Doom—   
His Office—but to execute   
Fate's—Telegram—to Him—
