One Joy of so much anguish—
Sweet nature has for me—
I shun It as I do Despair
Or dear iniquity—

Why Birds, a Summer morning—
Before the Quick of Day—
Should stab my ravished Spirit
With Dirks of Melody—

Is part of an inquiry
That will receive reply
When Flesh and Spirit sunder
In Death's Immediately—
